** Distinctive aspects of Christianity

- [[http://www.businessinsider.com/infographic-map-world-religions-2012-4][Circle graph of world religions]]
- *Proselytizing*: Built on premise of expansion of Judaism *(evangelize)*
- A religion that appropriated another's *sacred text*
- *Prophetic, Sacramental*, and *Mystical*
- *Sacred text* not essentially in original language (*translations*)
- Anchored in *history* i.e. linear history that is fulfilled, brought to perfection, 
- *progress* is built into the foundation of the religion
- *4 gospels* ,and many other issues, leads to a *critical* reading of scripture

 Note:
     - cf. we lived in Iran, we would think that Shia Islam was the only kind there was
     - living in US until recently it seemed as if Protestant Christianity was the only kind

*** From Judaism to Roman Empire

-  Jesus was not the first Christian. He was a Jew.
-  Paul's writing were the earliest testimony to the emerging Jewish sect
-  Paul established the pattern of *evangelism*
-  Only after the destruction of the temple by the Romans and dispersion (Diaspora) of the Jews did synagogue and church (*ecclesia*) separate

*** From Old Testament to "Holy Bible"

-  All of the writers of the NT understood the Bible to be what we would call the Old Testament
-  consensus on what was in the New Testament was not reached until 4th-5th c.
-  while the Rabbis pruned their Hebrew Bible, Christians continued to use the Jewish Bible from 300 BCE
-  Reformation (16th c. and following) brought new standards for what was in the Bible

Bible

*** Sacred Quest ch. 3: Appearance of the Sacred

Christianity displays each of the 3 patterns from /Sacred Quest/:

1. Prophetic
2. Sacramental
3. Mystical


#+BEGIN_notes
Note:
    - **Prophetic**; absorbing the OT prophets, John the Baptist as forerunner of Jesus, Jesus as the Prophet who is to come
    - **Sacramental** priests who preside over the appearance of sacred in ordinary material things: 2 primary sacraments of Christianity
    - **Mystical** from the transfiguration on the mountain to monks in the desert to spiritual writers through the centuries, growth of inner life is essential aspect

*** Overlap of 2 religions
- From the beginning of Christianity there has been conflict and division with Judaism
- in teaching the Old Testament I came to realize that that text is the only one I am aware of that is sacred to two different religions
- interplay of how Jews interpret the text and how Christians approach it differently

*** Anchored in *history*

-  eschatological
-  fulfillment of linear history (progress)
-  controversies over historical data are somehow peculiar to a
   particular brand of Christianity
-  importance of rise of historical / critical

*** *4 gospels* (and others)

- the "good news" were each written to bring about new followers
- relatively few details that are common across all 4 gospels
- *harmonizing* vs. *parallel*
- Some places to explore: http://www.gospelparallels.com/  http://sites.utoronto.ca/religion/synopsis/


** Origins

-  Paul established much of groundwork of early Christianity, but he's not the only one
-  Bishops, presbyters, deacons and growth of Orthodox Church
-  reputation as pacifist, care for widows and orphans, unwillingness to worship idols
-  in the 4th c. CE persecution pivoted to *status quo* after Emperor Constantine
-  need for *uniformity* led to creeds and orthodoxy, establishing canon of NT, theology, liturgical practice, etc.


** Theology to Creeds

1. *Orthodox* vs. *Orthopraxis*
2. *Heresy* repressed, censorship, persecution
3. *Creed*: "I believe ..."
