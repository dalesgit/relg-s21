* A Notion of Sacred Reality
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- *sacredness* provides a *boundary* between what is religious and what is not
- the *sacred* is other than *ordinary*

#+begin_notes
  - A notion of sacred reality establishes a boundary between religion and non-religion.
  - “Sacred” indicates a reality that is somehow distinct, “set apart,” “other” than ordinary.
  - “Sacred reality” includes the God of the Bible, the Qur’anic Allah, the Brahman of Hinduism, Buddhism’s Nirvana, the kami of Shinto.

* Manifest in Human Experience
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- although set apart from *ordinary*, nevertheless it is *experienced, thought about*, and *acted upon* in ordinary life.
- *manifest in various ways: ritual, persons, and natural phenomena*
#+begin_notes
  - Although the sacred is “set apart” from the ordinary, it nevertheless may be experienced, thought about, and acted upon. 
  - Thus, all religion has to do with “the element of the sacred” manifesting itself in various ways: in rituals, persons, and natural phenomena. 
    - Muslims = the sacred reality (Allah) is made manifest through prophecy
    - Buddhists = the goal of Nirvana “comes to life” in the life and teaching of the Buddha
    - Navaho = the story of the Navaho people makes wisdom available for those who seek harmony between all things.

* What is Sacred?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- *sacred* is complex and varied
- wide range of *phenomena*
- value is that *sacred* is not bound to any particular religious tradition
#+begin_notes
  - “Sacred” is a complex word because it is used for a wide range of phenomena: places, time, persons, events, and deities.
  - But, generally, when people speak of something as sacred, they mean to designate the thing in question as “other than ordinary.” 
  - In the broadest sense of the term, the sacred is the “extraordinary.” 
  - The value of using the term “sacred” is that it is not tradition specific.

* Sacred and Profane
* The Sacred and The Ordinary
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- *sacred* can be thought of as *the really real*
- provides *absolute and objective authority*
- a *different order* than the ordinary life of human beings
- vehicles of *sacred* can include: stones, trees, the sky, bodies of water, people ... all of whom share in the *distinctive reality*


#+begin_notes
- The sacred can further be characterized in terms of “the real.”
- The sacred stands for that which provides absolute and objective authority to an otherwise relative and subjective existence. 
- The sacred consists of an entirely different order than the ordinary life of human beings, but is manifest through ordinary existence.
- Stones, trees, the sky, bodies of water, various people—all these may be the vehicles of the sacred and thus share in its distinctive reality.

#+end_notes
* General Concept of the Sacred
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Sacred reality is present wherever something is *real* by 4 criteria:
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    - it is "set apart" from everything else in the world
    - it is in some sense beyond human control
    - it is in some sense vital for the well-being of humans
    - it orders human existence
