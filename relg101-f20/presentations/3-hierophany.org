- *different* & *similar*** to everyday life


**  Beyond Volitional Control of Humans

- eg. of 2 Sam. 6 ff. the *sacred* presence functions almost as a magical talisman
- while seemingly under human control, it is essentially the power of God not of Israelites / Philistines
- the *sacredness* of the ark seems to have a life of its own


   #+begin_notes
   
Uzzah and ark () (30)

- 2 Sam 6
- fair? just? 
- the sacred character of the ark seems to have a life of its own, "sovereignty or independence of the ark" (31)

- One practices Buddhism in order to attain Nirvana
- “all else is illusion”
- ultimate falsehood = the self
- to attain Nirvana is to see the truth
- *some would combine numbers 3 & 4 above*
