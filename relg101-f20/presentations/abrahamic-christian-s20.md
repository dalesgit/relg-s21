## Distinctive aspects of Christianity ##

1. **Proselytizing**: Built on premise of expansion of Judaism **(evangelize)**
2. Only religion to have appropriated another's **sacred text**
3. **Prophetic, Sacramental**, and **Mystical**
4. **Sacred text** not essentially in original language (**translations**)

5. Major **divisions**  [Circle graph of world religions](http://www.businessinsider.com/infographic-map-world-religions-2012-4)
6. Anchored in **history** i.e. linear history that is fulfilled, brought to perfection, **progress**
7. **4 gospels** (and others) i.e. **critical** reading of scripture

Note:

	- cf. we lived in Iran, we would think that that Shia Islam was the only kind there was
	- living in US until recently it seemed as if Protestant Christianity was the only kind

### From Judaism to Roman Empire ###

- Jesus was not the first Christian. He was a Jew.
- Paul's writing were the earliest testimony to the emerging Jewish sect

### From Old Testament to "Holy Bible"

- All of the writers of the NT understood the Bible to be what we would call the Old Testament
- consensus on what was in the New Testament was not reached until 4th-5th c.
- while the Rabbis pruned their Hebrew Bible, Christians continued to use the Jewish Bible from 300 BCE
- Reformation (16th c. and following) brought new standards for what was in the Bible


Note:
- leading to divisions still to this day about what is in the Bible

### Sacred Quest ch. 3: Appearance of the Sacred ###

Christianity displays each of the 3 patterns:

1. Prophetic
2. Sacramental
3. Mystical

Note:

	- **Prophetic**; absorbing the OT prophets, John the Baptist as forerunner of Jesus, Jesus as the Prophet who is to come
	- **Sacramental** priests who preside over the appearance of sacred in ordinary material things: 2 primary sacraments of Christianity
	- **Mystical** from the transfiguration on the mountain to monks in the desert to spiritual writers through the centuries, growth of inner life is essential aspect

### Overlap of 2 religions ###

- in teaching the Old Testament I came to realize that that text is the only one I am aware of that is sacred to two different religions
