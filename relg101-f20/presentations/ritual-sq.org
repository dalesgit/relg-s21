** Ritual Defined
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: ritual-defined
   :END:

-  A ritual is a ceremonial act or a repeated stylized gesture used for
   specific occasions.
-  In society, there are many civic rituals.

   -  In American courts, raising the right hand, swearing on the Bible,
      and reciting an oath signifies the obligation to tell the truth.

-  In everyday life we participate in numerous personal rituals.
-  Shaking hands as a sign of mutual trust
-  Standing in honor of a particular person

   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section
   :END:

-  Give an example of a ritual that orders your interaction with others.
-  What is a ritual that has important meaning for you and your friends
   or family? Explain.
-  How does ritual help us to understand the ways that religion is more
   than a set of beliefs?
-  What are the best arguments for and against the following claim:
   “Religion begins with ritual and it remains ritual before it is
   anything else.”
-  How can ritual go wrong? What happens when it goes right?

** Ritual in Religious Contexts
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: ritual-in-religious-contexts
   :END:

-  Ritual plays an important role in every religious tradition.
-  Some religions are famous for their ritual character.

   -  Roman Catholicism
   -  Russian Orthodoxy

-  Other religions are known for their resistance to ritual, but even
   these religions have certain stylized forms of behavior that are
   rituals.
-  Society of Friends (Quakers)

** Mythos and Ritual
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: mythos-and-ritual
   :END:

-  One of the most common forms of ritual involves acting out or
   dramatizing religious stories.
-  The conjunction of myth and ritual serves as a way for people to
   participate in the creative power of the sacred.
-  In many tribal societies people not only remember the tribal myths
   but also live them and act them out.

** Ritual Reenactment
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: ritual-reenactment
   :END:

-  In tribal societies, creation stories may be ritualized through dance
   and gesture at particular times of the year so that people reenact -
   the first deeds of gods and goddesses.
-  The Greek tragedy is derived from the ritualized worship of the
   Dionysus.
-  The modern drama derives from the acting out of the Easter story in
   French monasteries during the Middle Ages.

** The Passover
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: the-passover
   :END:

-  The *Passover* meal is also called the seder, a Hebrew word that
   means “order” or “arrangement.”
-  Commemorates the meal eaten by the Jews as the were delivered from
   slavery
-  Retelling the story of the *Exodus* is central to the meal
-  The *Passover* meal is not merely a historical remembrance.
-  For Jews participating in the Passover meal, there is a combination
   of memory, worship, and hope.
-  To celebrate the Passover is to become ritually one with those who
   first observed it before leaving Egypt.
-  Thus, Jews celebrate an ancient story in their tradition by
   reenacting the story in a highly ritualized fashion

Note: - At Passover, Jews all over the world gather in their homes to
share a formal meal involving the eating of symbolic foods, various
readings and prayers, and a number of blessings. - The meal is
orchestrated by the head of the household, who conducts it according to
well established traditions.

-  Passover commemorates the meal eaten by the Jews the evening before
   they left Egypt and the enslavement of their people in order to
   journey toward, and eventually reach, the Promised Land.
-  Central to the Passover meal are the great events described in the
   Bible in the book of Exodus.
-  One of the high points of the meal comes when the youngest person
   present at the table asks why the meal is eaten. The response comes
   in the form of a reading from the haggadah.

** Holy Communion
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: holy-communion
   :END:

-  *Holy Communion* in Christianity functions in ways that are analogous
   to the *Passover* in Judaism.
-  The various Christian communities give diverse interpretations of the
   significance of communion.
-  However, all Christian groups agree that when they celebrate the
   communion meal, they are reenacting events connected with Jesus of
   Nazareth.

-  The gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, as well as the letter of Paul
   known as First Corinthians, describe a ceremony involving the use of
   bread and wine, which are given significance through words attributed
   to Jesus.
-  Holy Communion is a ritual reenactment of this story.
-  Like the Passover meal, the celebration of Holy Communion carries a
   meaning that the community of believers, long after the event itself,
   wishes to restate.

** Other examples of Religious Rituals
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: other-examples-of-religious-rituals
   :END:

-  In *Shi'a Islam*, the “passion plays” of the month of Muharram
   reenact the martyrdom of Husayn at Karbala in 692 C.E. and draw
   members of the Shi'i community into an eternal drama in which good
   suffers in its struggle with evil.
-  In Shinto, the rituals performed at shrines throughout Japan reenact
   the conflict between Amaterasu (the sun goddess) and Susanoo (the god
   of storms) and enable participants to feel themselves a part of the
   struggle to bring order to the world.

** Rites of Passage
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rites-of-passage
   :END:

-  Rites of passage describe those ceremonies associated with the
   transitional moments in a person's life.
-  All religions provide rituals of some sort or another
-  Rituals may be turned to be *nominal* believers to observe customs of
   tradition (e.g. weddings)
-  *All rites of passage have three phases---separation, liminal, and
   reintegration.*

Note: - All religions provide rituals and/or theological rationales to
commemorate such moments. - Even nominal believers who feel no great
need to observe most of the customs of a tradition may still turn to
religion for rites of passage.

** Types of rituals
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: types-of-rituals
   :END:

-  Birth rituals
-  Rites of Initiation
-  Rituals of Mourning & Death
-  Rites of passage of time, e.g. cycle of the year, cycle of seasons

Note:

** Birth Rituals
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: birth-rituals
   :END:

-  Although some traditional cultures actually ritualize the moment of
   birth, “birth rituals” usually refer to rites connected to the
   newborn and its parents.
-  For Jews and Muslims, circumcision initiates male children into the
   religious community.
-  In Christian communities, baptism makes the child a member of the
   Christian church.
-  Hindus use a ritualized feeding to initiate a male member into the
   duties of his caste.

-  Similar meanings are given to birth rituals in the various religious
   traditions, even though the forms are quite diverse.
-  People celebrate the safe passage of the infant from the womb into
   the world; they welcome him or her into the family; they give the
   child a name; they pay homage to the creative power of the sacred.

** Rituals of Initiation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rituals-of-initiation
   :END:

-  Rituals of initiation celebrate and symbolize the passage of a person
   from childhood into adulthood.
-  While the specifics of this rite varied in different cultures, the
   outlines of the ceremony remained rather constant:

   -  ritual segregation from the larger group and some form of testing
   -  the actual ceremonies of initiation
   -  reentry into the group as a recognized adult

** Initiation Rites in Postmodern Society
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: initiation-rites-in-postmodern-society
   :END:

-  In contemporary society, many young people go through a traditional
   rite of passage, but the “adults” are not really adults for some time
   after their “passage.”
-  Today, the most common ritual of initiation is marriage.
-  Many elements of the marriage rite hearken back to ancient rituals.

** Rituals of Mourning and Death
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rituals-of-mourning-and-death
   :END:

-  Different religious traditions ritualize the mourning process in
   various ways.

   -  Taoist rites include an elaborate ritual involving an enactment of
      the soul's journey into the underworld and its rescue and delivery
      into heaven by ancestral spirits.

-  Many burial rites symbolize the relationship of human beings to the
   natural world.

   -  Pious Hindus in India cremate their dead and consign the ashes to
      the river Ganges as a sign of the never-ending cycle of life and
      death.

** Rituals of Mourning and Death
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rituals-of-mourning-and-death-1
   :END:

-  Funeral rites are intended to accomplish different ends in different
   cultures.
-  To aid the spirits of the dead to journey through the afterworld
   either by providing symbolic gifts for them (ancient Egyptians and
   native peoples of North America).
-  To provide living “guides” for the dead (Taoism).
-  To help the souls of the dead to purge sin (Roman Catholicism and
   Orthodoxy).

** Temporal Rites and Celebrations
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: temporal-rites-and-celebrations
   :END:

-  The observance of cycles of time has been a central characteristic of
   most, if not all, historic religious traditions.
-  For people who hunted, gathered, or planted, the cycle of the seasons
   was crucial to life. As a result, great celebrations and rituals were
   associated with the change of the seasons.
-  Even in modern industrial societies, many of the great festivals
   continue to take place in conjunction with the change of the seasons.

** Religious Meanings of Ritual
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: religious-meanings-of-ritual
   :END:

-  Ritual is so closely identified with formal worship that one can
   generally say that the ends of ritual are the ends of worship.
-  Traditionally speaking, worship promotes one of these four ends or
   purposes, or a combination of them:

   -  Adoration
   -  Thanksgiving
   -  Petition
   -  Penance/purification

** Adoration
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: adoration
   :END:

-  Basically, adoration means acknowledgment of the sovereignty of the
   Sacred over the person.
-  Adoration means the acknowledgment that one is not self-sufficient,
   but dependent.
-  In religions with a personal, transcendent God, there are basic
   ritual gestures assumed in moments of prayer that dramatically
   illustrate the concept of adoration.
-  In religions without a transcendent deity, the focus is on the search
   for enlightenment and the primary gesture of adoration is meditative.

** Thanksgiving
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: thanksgiving
   :END:

-  Because one of the basic insights of many religious traditions is
   that the world and all its bounty flow from the world of the sacred,
   it is only fitting that such traditions emphasize the need to
   acknowledge that gift.
-  The most common form of thanksgiving is the ritual act of giving a
   gift. Such donations may run from the formal act of a sacrifice, to
   the leaving of a gift at an altar or shrine
