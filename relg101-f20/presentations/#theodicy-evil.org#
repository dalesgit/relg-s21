-  the challenge

** What is the Problem of Evil?*

- actually a cluster of "problems" related to understanding *Sacred
  reality*
- Why does good fortune turn to bad? (*Psalms*)
- Why do the righteous suffer and the wicked flourish? (*Hindu*)

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Note: - The problem of evil actually represents not a single problem but
a cluster of issues arising from the attempt to relate a diverse set of
experiences to notions of sacred reality. - Drawing on the tradition of
his faith community, for example, the psalmist asks, in effect, Why does
good fortune turn to bad? - In a very different context, a critic of
Hindu beliefs asks a different sort of question: Why do the righteous
suffer and the wicked flourish?

** Logical dilemma
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: logical-dilemma
    :END:

-  In religious traditions that stress the power and goodness of one God
   who rules over all creation, the existence of evil presents a logical
   dilemma.

   -  If God is good and powerful, what is the nature of evil?
   -  If God could prevent evil but does not, can God be good?
   -  On the other hand, if God is good but cannot prevent evil, can God
      be powerful?


** Problem of Evil (Christianity)

/We have heard with our ears, O God, our ancestors have told us, what deeds you performed in their days, in the days of old; you with your own hand drove out the nations. . . . Yet you have rejected us and abased us, and have not gone out with our armies. You made us turn back from the foe, and our enemies have gotten spoil/. (Psalm 44:12a, 910)

/The world is so confused and out of joint, why does Brahma not set it straight? If he is master of the whole world, Brahma, lord of the many beings born, why in the whole world did he ordain misfortune? Why did he not make the whole world happy? . . .Why did he make the world with deception, lies, and excess, with injustice?/

* Theodicy
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: theodicy
   :END:

-  God is all-merciful. God is all-powerful. God is perfect-justice.
-  Any 2 of these can be held at the same time - but not all 3
-  even non-theists must explain the presence of evil & suffering (cf. e.g. a psychologists perspective: [[http://www.gurteen.com/gurteen/gurteen.nsf/id/X0038E2E2/][Scott Peck]])

#+BEGIN_NOTES

Note: - When the problem of evil is raised in connection with belief in God or gods, we may describe them as issues of *theodicy*, or divine justice. - However, even those religious traditions that stress the impersonal nature of the sacred, must seek to explain the existence of evil or suffering in the world.

Note: - For Jews, the challenge of the Holocaust involves the
relationship of the destruction of Europe's Jews to the notion that
there is a God who governs history according to a plan and that all the
events of Jewish history have a meaning in the plan of God. - For
Christians, the problem is slightly different and involves the following
question: In the death camps, where was Christ?

   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: the-holocaust-shoah
   :END:

- In the modern West, no single experience raises the questions
  associated with the problem of evil with greater power than the
  *Holocaust*.
- The *Holocaust* illustrates the general point of how religious people
  identify evil in terms of a contradiction between the facts of
  experience and the reality of the sacred.
- The *Holocaust* challenges some of the central affirmations of Jewish
  and Christian faith.

#+BEGIN_NOTES

Note: - *Karma*, signifies the moral weight of one's actions. Good or
proper action results in good karma and in progress toward the goal of
enlightenment. - In connection with the problem of evil, *karma* is a
kind of inexorable reality that explains the destiny of human beings.
People get what they deserve at least, over the long cycle of time. -
The inexorability of *karma* is the problem addressed in the Buddhist
story of The Death of Moggallana.

#+BEGIN_NOTES

Note: - The brute facts of cruelty and pain are not simply the luck of
the draw, nor are they connected with the will of God. - One who attains
enlightenment knows that the resolution of the experiences associated
with evil does not depend on gods or goddesses, nor does it depend on
other human beings. - In the fundamental sense, the solution to the
problem of evil depends on each individual person.

*The Consolation of Promise*

-  At some future time, evil will be overcome, justice will be
   satisfied, and the point of suffering will be made clear.

   #+BEGIN_HTML
     <li class="fragment">
   #+END_HTML

   Such a response uses the language of promise, offering consolation
   and hope to those currently suffering.

     <li class="fragment">

** Jewish Perspective on Evil
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: jewish-perspective-on-evil
   :END:

-  Jews wait for a *Messiah who is yet to come*.
-  When the anointed one arrives, he will reestablish the nation of
   Israel and will rule the other nations with a rod of iron.
-  some Orthodox groups oppose the nation of Israel *because the Messiah
   has not yet come.*


#+BEGIN_NOTES

Note: - It is significant that a number of Orthodox groups hold that the
contemporary state of Israel is not a fulfillment of this promise. -
Rather, they view the Jewish state as a violation of the Torah, a
manifestation of the impatience and disobedience of humanity rather than
the work of God.

** Christian Response to Evil
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: christian-response-to-evil
   :END:

-  Christianity holds that the *Messiah has come*: Jesus of Nazareth is
   the Messiah.
-  His life, death, and resurrection manifest the promise of God to
   bring about a peaceable kingdom.
-  The work of Jesus is not yet complete, however. For, he will come
   again in glory to judge the living and the dead; and his reign will
   have no end.
-  The doctrine of the *parousia* or the second coming of Christ
   indicates that the fulfillment of the promise is yet to come.


** Muslim Response to Evil
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: muslim-response-to-evil
   :END:

-  Islam also embodies the promise theme common to Judaism and
   Christianity.
-  An idea appears in the Islamic tradition that the *mahdi* will come
   or appear at the time God decides and will establish the rule of
   justice and equity on earth.
-  Islam also refers to an afterlife in which *good will be rewarded,
   evil punished, and suffering explained.*
-  Through a *Day of Resurrection and Judgment, God will resolve the
   problem of evil.*


* Reponses to the Problem of Evil
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: reponses-to-the-problem-of-evil-1
   :END:

*Appeal to Sovereignty*

-  The sovereignty appeal finds its power in affirming that, at least
   from the human standpoint, there are no solutions to the problem of
   evil.

   #+BEGIN_HTML
     <li class="fragment">
   #+END_HTML

   The book of *Job* may be taken as the archetype of the sovereignty
   response. As such, it has both baffled and comforted believers
   throughout generations of Jewish and Christian faith.

** The Story of Job
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: the-story-of-job
   :END:

-  God tests Jobs faith to see if his obedience to God is motivated by
   his own integrity or desire for personal gain.

   #+BEGIN_HTML
     <li class="fragment">
   #+END_HTML

   Job rejects the idea that his suffering is for his education or to
   make him better

   #+BEGIN_HTML
     </li>
   #+END_HTML

   #+BEGIN_HTML
     <li class="fragment">
   #+END_HTML

   Job also rejects the idea that his suffering is in proportion to some
   sin he has committed.

   #+BEGIN_HTML
     </li>
   #+END_HTML

   #+BEGIN_HTML
     <li class="fragment">
   #+END_HTML

   In the end, God claims the wisdom of the creator of all things and
   Job accepts the finitude of human understanding and the sovereignty
   of the maker of heaven and earth.

** Responses to the Problem of Evil:
   :PROPERTIES:

*Dualism*

-  Evil is the result of a conflict between good and evil powers, *both
   of which share some of the characteristics of sacred reality.*

   #+BEGIN_HTML
     <li class="fragment">
   #+END_HTML

   From the perspective of dualism, *God is good but God's sovereignty
   faces a severe challenge from those powers that do evil in the
   world.*

   #+BEGIN_HTML
     </li>
   #+END_HTML

   #+BEGIN_HTML
     <li class="fragment">
   #+END_HTML

   Many religious traditions embody elements of dualism, but the best
   example is in *Zoroastrianism.*

** Zoroastrian Response to Evil
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: zoroastrian-response-to-evil
   :END:

-  Struggle between *Spenta Mainyu* (beneficent spirit) and *Angra
   Mainyu* (hostile spirit), whose conflict stems from the beginning of
   all things and continues to the end of time.
-  *Spenta Mainyu* and *Angra Mainyu* are twins, offspring of the wise
   lord *Ahura Mazda*, the creator of all things.
-  *Ahura Mazdas* twins represent the moral choice set before all
   creatures. Evil comes into the world as a result of wrongful choice,
   and the proper response is thus to fight against it.
