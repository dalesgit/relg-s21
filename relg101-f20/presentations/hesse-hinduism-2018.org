** Questions
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. When you attempt to understand a new religious tradition, what is the
   most important thing to learn? Would you focus on its doctrines, the
   way it tells stories, its art, its rituals, or its institutions?
   Would you focus on something else?
2. If you were trying to explain your own religious tradition to someone
   who knew nothing about it, what would be the most important thing for
   that person to learn?

* Hinduism

** Timeline

[[https://www.preceden.com/timelines/274460-buddhism---hinduism]]

** Veda
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  most authoritative text for Hinduism
-  composed between 2300 and 1200 B.C.E.
-  e.g. The oldest and most important of these collections contains more
   than a thousand songs to various gods and goddesses and is aptly
   named the Rig, meaning praise. Scholars believe it was composed
   between 2300 and 1200 B.C.E.

** Humans

-  The Veda regarded humans as being individual souls
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   -  and members of a stratified society.
   -  For the Aryans, the essence of human life is the soul, which they
      associated with the *breath*, designated by the word *atman*.
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  The Aryans' strong emphasis on *ritual* over *doctrine and belief* -
   was the basis of the Vedic tradition.
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Note: The Veda regarded humans as being individual souls and members of
a stratified society. For the Aryans, the essence of human life is the
soul, which they associated with the breath, designated by the word
tman. The Sanskrit atman has cognates in the English word atmosphere and
the German word atmen, which means to breathe.


#+END_NOTES

* Classical Hinduism
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Transformations of thought in the Axial Age (c. 800--200 B.C.E.) led
   to the re-evaluation of Vedic ritual and new ideas about the nature
   of human existence.
-  Deeper spiritual questions led to the examination of human nature and
   the possibility of an *afterlife*.
-  (/This evolution in Indian religion was roughly contemporaneous with similar developments in other civilizations, including ancient Greece, China, Mesopotamia, and Israel./)
-  The function of religion changed from that of *cosmic maintenance* to
   one of *personal enlightenment* and transformation.
#+REVEAL: split
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Classical Hinduism established the central problem of human existence
   for Hindus -- *samsara*, the cycle of continual *transmigrations of
   the soul*.
-  *Karma*, even good *karma*, keeps a person bound to the cycle of
   transmigration. One path the Hindu tradition offers for the
   attainment of *moksha*, or ultimate release, is the path of wisdom.
#+REVEAL: split
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  The path of wisdom found in the Axial Age, when the most important
   Hindu responses to the anxieties about death and rebirth were
   recorded in a collection of texts called the *Upanishads*. The oldest
   of the *Upanishads* was probably composed between 800--400 B.C.E.,
   but actually written down much later.
-  Modern Hinduism has had to face challenges brought by the advent of
   Islam and Western culture.
