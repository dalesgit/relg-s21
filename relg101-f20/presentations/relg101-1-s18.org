*** Essay questions
1. How can ritual go wrong? What happens when it goes right?
2. What are the best arguments for and against the following claim: "Religion begins with ritual and it remains ritual before it is anything else."
3. Using examples from the drama *G-d on Trial*, discuss how bringing the *beit din* against G-d made a kind of sense to the prisoners in the light of G-d's *covenant* with Israel, his Torah which for 3,500 years breathed life into Judaism, and the threat to the survival of the people. Offer an explanation for why the prisoners prayed to G-d after finding him guilty.
4. We have identified 4 basic responses that religions have made to our experience of suffering and evil. *Why does good fortune turn to bad? (Psalms) Why do the righteous suffer and the wicked flourish? (Hindu)* Describe and briefly explain the 4 basic responses.
5. When asked, “Was my silence at the bedside of the dying Nazi right or wrong?”, what does Simon say is the crux of the matter?
6. End Response:  “You, who have just read this sad and tragic episode in my life, can mentally change places with me and ask yourself the same question, ‘What would I have done?’”  What is your initial response to this overwhelming question?  You answer here will lay the foundation for your formal essay on the questions of forgiving, forgetting, and remembering.  Answer wisely and honestly.
7. Eva Fleischner found that almost without exception, her Christian students "come out in favor of forgiveness, while the Jewish students feel that Simon did the right thing by not granting the dying man’s wish" (p. 139). Do you feel that the Christian and Jewish writers in this volume are similarly divided? Do their differences stem from first-hand experience, or from different notions of sin and repentance, as Dennis Prager suggests? Do any writers in this book seriously suggest forgiveness??and why? Do you believe, with political theorist Herbert Marcuse, that "the easy forgiving of such crimes perpetuates the very evil it wants to alleviate" (p. 198)?[fn:1]
8. Many of the Symposium contributors believe that even as he lay dying, Karl saw the Jews as objects or subhumans, and that his wish to confess to a Jew, any Jew, and a concentration camp prisoner at that, showed that he had learned nothing from his experiences. Do you agree with this?
9. "Without forgetting there can be no forgiving," says retired Israeli Supreme Court Justice Moshe Bejski (p. 116); the Dalai Lama, on the other hand, believes that one must forgive but not necessarily forget. Do you think it is possible to forgive and not forget? How would you differentiate forgiveness and reconciliation?
10. "I asked myself if it was only the Nazis who had persecuted us. Was it not just as wicked for people to look on quietly and without protest at human beings enduring such shocking humiliation?" (p. 57). Some of the commentators believe that those who were following orders were just as guilty as those who gave them; others, like Dith Pran, draw a moral line between followers and leaders. Would you hold them equally responsible?
11. Assignment:  Write an essay in which you examine the complex topics of forgiving, forgetting, and remembering, in respect to the crimes committed during the Holocaust.  In your essay, you MUST attempt to answer each of the questions Simon poses at the end of The Sunflower.

“Was my silence at the bedside of the dying Nazi right or wrong?  Did I even have the right to forgive?  What moral obligation do we have to remember?  What should I have done?”

 1. How can ritual go wrong? What happens when it goes right?
 2. What are the best arguments for and against the following claim: “Religion begins with ritual and it remains ritual before it is anything else.”
 3. Dehumanization is the process by which the Nazis gradually reduced the Jews to little more than “things” which were a nuisance to them. Discuss at least three specific examples of events that occurred which dehumanized Eliezer, his father, or his fellow Jews.
 4. Discuss why you think the townspeople remained complacent despite the advance of the German army? Why did the villages surrounding the concentration camps do nothing to stop the Nazis? Use at least 2 illustrations from the memoir.
 5. In the context of *Night*, what does it mean to be a *witness*? How does Wiesel function in this role? How is it both an individual and communal responsibility?
 6. Wiesel writes, “Never shall I forget that night”; he then recalls his first night in the camps. What will Elie never forget that turned his “life into one long night seven times sealed”? What is different about this passage in terms of style? What purpose does it serve in the narrative?
 7. As the summer was coming to an end, thousands gathered to participate in the *Rosh Hashanah* service.

 8. Discuss the significance of “night” in the novel. Cite examples from the story to support your answer.
 9. Given its haunting, clearly rendered, and universal themes of suffering and survival in the face of absolute evil, *Night* is a book that is likely to be echoed or suggested in other works you encounter. In other words, it is a classic. Identify two other books that – in your view – echo or expand on Wiesel’s classic. Explain your choices, using clear examples from *Night* and your examples.
 10. Using examples from the drama *G-d on Trial*, discuss how bringing the *beit din* against G-d made a kind of sense to the prisoners in the light of G-d’s *covenant* with Israel, his Torah which for 3,500 years breathed life into Judaism, and the threat to the survival of the people. Offer an explanation for why the prisoners prayed to G-d after finding him guilty.
 11. We have identified 4 basic responses that religions have made to our experience of suffering and evil. *Why does good fortune turn to bad? (Psalms) Why do the righteous suffer and the wicked flourish? (Hindu)* Describe and briefly explain the 4 basic responses.
*** Grade Night paper

**** RELG 101-2

 - Berry, Ramonica A: There are writing and grammatical issues that sometimes get in the way of what you intend to say.Your argument about morals and values ends up being confusing. It may be true but your treatment of the examples hasn't clarified it for us the reader. Your writing is a weakness in your paper but the passion that you bring to the illustrations and especially to the racism that is prevalent in our country today is helpful. It is just such a passion that Wiesel  brings to his Memoir night. B
 - Brown, Deanndra A. S. M.: Your paper needs an opening so that the reader can know where you're going. It is helpful very often to write an introduction with a thesis statement after you have written your paper.  I like the opening sentence about it being a test of faith and a test for Humanity. to explain what you mean by that is a tall order. As important as your contemporary examples are they are not developed in a way to match the evidence you've gathered before it.  your sex trafficking illustration is a very good one that would Merit further comparisons and illustrations.  B+
 - Burchell, Lee-Syonne F: Good opening but your structure needs correction with punctuation and paragraphing. Good illustrations and good use of resource. A
 - Christian, Ty: So your answer to that prompt is in effect all of the above. Your writing is at time very awkward and vague.There is no contemporary illustration of the point that you are making. B
 - Davis, Jakob P: You have writing errors that ought to be easily corrected. perhaps proofreading or perhaps some help from The Writing Center might be in order. The point you're making in your opening is in fact very well-thought-out. I take it that what you mean is something like the frog in a pot of water where the water is gradually increased until it's boiling and the Frog is dead. York comparisons with contemporary illustrations are not developed sufficiently. Nice thoughtful effort. B+
 - Dawson, Brooklyn E Bad submission
 - Diggs, Payton D: Clear and well written.Good illustration that you bring about the Syrian Civil War. You don't elaborate as much as you could have as to how it illustrates a failure of emotion. good effort. A
 - Fernicola, Haley: You're opening paragraph needed to be divided into several. There are writing errors that most of which could have been corrected with a more thorough proofreading.I was really hoping that you would provide a contemporary illustration for your thesis that it is actually all three of the reasons put forth as an explanation for the evil. You don't give a contemporary example however. There had to be sources that you were using to get your considerable historical background and they needed to be cited. B
 - Fields, Donivan L Your paper needs a clear introduction that normally would feature a thesis directing the reader for where your paper is going to go. The structure of your Reflections here are wandering. The notion of Silence that Wiesel gives us is as you note Central to his perspective. In addition to the structural problems there are some writing errors that make your sentences more ambiguous than they ought to be. You put a lot of good thought into this. I appreciate that thank you.B
 - Gaither, LeNiyae A: You're  passionate response to the similarities between Nazi Germany and the present day in our country reminded me of a saying attributed to a German pastor, Martin Niemöller, at the time of Hitler's rise. You may know of it. 
 First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—
 Because I was not a Socialist.
 Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out— 
 Because I was not a Trade Unionist.
 Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out— 
 Because I was not a Jew.
 Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.

 Unfortunately you don't have a clear thesis that you're trying to argue in your essay here. Your passion comes through but a sense of understanding or resolution with a conclusion escapes you at the moment. thank you for that passion. B+ 

 - Garcia Sorta, Misael A. Bad submission
 - Gause, Keyana C: Your submission is inadequate.
 - Graham, Darius J: Some writing and grammar errors. Opening paragraphs are irrelevant to the assignment. Good illustrations. Is “embarrassement” a sufficient explanation for the evil? In the end you point to “bad information.” Your paper has good points to make, even insightful but it is not organized sufficiently to have an impact. C
 - Hughes, Baylee K: Your paper is well structured and well written. There are several minor spelling and writing errors. I really appreciate the originality of your using the example of women in Saudi Arabia. Thank you. A+
 - Johnson, Daniel E: bad submission: Resubmit. Writing errors, spelling etc., weaken your passionate essay. The connection between deity and morality is not at all clear. We haven't talked about it in class. "Evil disguised as morals" is a vague statement needing explication. Your focus is overly global and one result is that you don't deal with Wiesel's book -- a part of the assignment. I hope you will be able to pursue your interest in this basic human question. B
 - Johnson, Drew: There are writing issues that follow you through the paper. perhaps proofreading would help. Perhaps also help from The Writing Center. There is no contemporary example to illustrate the point that you are making about the Shoah. B
 - Jones, Jemaya G Ambivalent opening. Confusion over what your thesis actually is. Good illustration re. The violence against blacks in the US. B+
 - Jones, Taiyah J: You need to double space your submissions. You're opening paragraph doesn't provide the reader with a Way Forward end feels like extraneous information that you have drawn from somewhere. Your clear thesis is presented in the opening of your second paragraph. They're incorrect word usages that affect the meaning of what you're trying to say. In the end your paper is so sprawling that it's hard to know what point you're making. that means that what it really needed was a lot of tight editing. B 
 - Leyers, Connor W: You identify well the irony of the Germans perpetuating anti-Semitic appalling actions. You're opening paragraph leaves me confused however with what you make of the authors memoir and it's a count of one man's experience of the Holocaust. You end up finding a variety of different causes. in the end it's clear that you appreciate the nuances of the question but don't yet have a clear response to it. B
 - Merriweather, Larry L
 - Patel, Neel: There is confusion with your choice of words throughout the paper. You need an opening with a thesis to direct the reader. Too much vague word choice. The thesis that it is both failure of reason & values is perceptive & even insightful. No contemporary illustrations. B-
 - Patrick, Demetrius J.
 - Quick, Joy
 - Reid, Alexia J: MLA standards require double spaced typing. It is unclear what your opening paragraph about any quality has to do with the prompt for the assignment. Is that what you mean by discrimination? There are writing and grammatical errors. A number of times I was left confused about where you were going. My sense is that you were getting this background information from some place and if you had cited that it might have been clear what you were doing. By the end of your essay it's clear that your sense of Injustice is aroused both in the experience of African Americans in the US today as well as the Jews experience in the Germany of Adolf Hitler. B
 - Robinson, Danielle J Some writing problems. The thesis is descriptive, not offering an answer to the assignment prompt. Good illustration of US police brutality against minorities. B+
 - Ross, Justin S: ?
 - Ruppe, Cameron D: Fair appraisal re. Apathy as a cause for not getting involved. How does that influence or compare to the points you argue about values? Lack of clarity there. Some writing errors. Main points not fully developed. A-
 - Taylor, Laura M: You end up combining several good observations one that silence is perhaps a response to the mystery of how such a thing could happen. Later in your paper you attribute the actions that are primarily asked about here to “social norms”. Your final paragraph is exceedingly pessimistic and is I think your real answer to the opening question. People are evil. that was really your thesis and ought to have gone at the beginning of the paper as well as forming the conclusion. A-
 - Taylor, Madison D: There are some relatively minor writing and grammatical errors. On page 2 I'm confused by your statement about the value of life.I think your example of Darfur actually argues against the case you were making. We in this country were in a position to be able to see exactly what was going on and for a variety of reasons failed to take action. A-
 - Trella, Becky N. : I think that you are exactly correct that the Silence of the world is why Elie Wiesel is writing as he does. you needed a clear statement at the end of your first paragraph as to what you were going to do with that information. Your observation about how  Totalitarianism controls education as being a part of the explanation for Holocaust deniers. Thank you. And also your illustration about the abuse and assault on women that is similar to the circumstances that we see with Shoah. Your reflections are like a string of discrete thoughts that are apt in and of themselves but none of them add up to a single or a closely argued response to the prompt to the paper. You might have presented a thesis along the lines of the answer is none of the above. there is something in the nature of human beings that lead us to avoid taking responsibility and also two abused one another. I'm not sure. But it bears pursuit for you I think. Thank you for your thoughts. A-
 - Vaughn, Vanessa T: Your paper needs to be structured with paragraphs and The Ordering of the points that you want to make. It is often helpful to write an opening paragraph with a thesis statement after one has finished writing the whole essay. Your thesis is actually somewhat complicated because it's made up of two parts. the first part is that desperation leads to dramatic actions that might often be detrimental or evil. The other is that vulnerability leads to the fear and Desperation  that is then a Cause for evil. In the end you produce a well argued essay  as you connect the phenomena with the response of the United States to 911.B+
 - Watford, Kate E: You clearly what to say more than that the evil was a result of a failure of reason. You go on to also deny that it is the essential evil in human beings. but rather a failure of emotions and values. That's a tall order but you've clearly stated it. As far as this essay goes who did a good job. There is much left to reflect on however for you as you go forward with your life. A-
 - Wilson, Amber N.



**** Relg 101-1

 - Armstrong, Aubry S: Thank you for resubmitting your paper.  The chief weakness in your paper has to do with understanding what morals might be and how your illustrations drawn from the text would support your argument. Your reflection is fairly well structured and written well. good work. A-
 - Barnett, Wilson F: There are some writing errors. There are also some structural errors. I suggest that you write a introductory paragraph after you have finished writing your paper. That way it can be clear and concise. I appreciate your use of the genocide in Cambodia. B
 - Bradner, Julianne N: You start your paper with a powerful quote and end up with a clear thesis to point your way in the paper. There are a variety of writing errors that seem to be simply a result of a failure in proofreading. My own reading of the events is that a leave is Wiesel  understands that fear that leads to silence is a major contributor to evil. That is why his writing is so important both to him and the world. You seem to capture some of that in your writing. Thank you.A 
 - Brigance, Akevia K: Good clear thesis statement. Some minor grammatical problems. Good effort. A 
 - Bringley, Alex M: Your thesis then is that evil as such is impossible to understand. and also that people generally don't want to look at the effects of evil.  the notion that evil is impossible to understand might be explained by a desire not to look at it. Your example of the charities in the United States and the corruption involved is accurate and intriguing as you applied it to the text. A 
 - Broome, Tristan M: You're opening paragraph lacks a clear statement of thesis where you are going to argue. You also make references to the testimony of officers after the fact and such a claim needs to have a citation. Your examples about the opening actions described in the  book do not demonstrate your claim that it is a failure of reason. There is confusion in the following paragraph about the Jews failure to reason. I guess just a careless mistake. There is no contemporary example in your paper. C
 - Buck, Clare M: Clearly written opening paragraph. Thank you. Excellent paper thank you. A+ 
 - Burton, Lindsey E
 - Cacace, Samantha K.: Good effort. The paper is Well written and follow the prompts. Your argument is basically that the people acted out of ignorance which has a Corollary that if the people had been taught or told the truth they wouldn't have acted the way they did. experience suggests that that that's not a complete explanation for people's behavior.A
 - Chavis, A'Mya L: There are writing errors that ought to have been corrected with a proofreading. Your first paragraph leaves me unclear about where you're going in the essay. My strong suggestion is that you write your opening paragraph after you have written your whole paper. As you have written the first paragraph it's really a kind of summary almost and a abstract of the paper. Second paragraph begins with passionate language but the meaning of which I'm not sure of. you refer to Wiesel’s book as a novel. I appreciate your effort to get a feel for what it was really like to be in Eli's Shoes.  it shows that you really thought about this assignment. C+ 
 - Cribb, Cassie R: Some relatively minor writing errors. Your thesis is that it all comes down to hatred. probably so. and as difficult to explain as is evil itself. The bystander effect is exactly an appropriate example for what this paper was asking about. A proofreading of the paper might have been able to break it into reasonable paragraphs. B+
 - Davis, Andrew C: MLA calls for double spaced typing. Do you really want to call the book a novel? Your paper is well structured and well written thank you. you probably needed some citations as in for example debate.org. A
 - Dunn, Chase P
 - Epps, Kira T.: There are major writing errors. it might help to use the Writing Center to help you proofread. Your use of concept like brainwashing are not clear to begin with. Citations to help explain for the reader what you mean might be in order. I really sense that behind the very awkward presentation in your paper is a passionate response to the question. There is clearly poignant and Power behind your example of slavery. and your ironic observation that it is just the American way of life illustrate your point of view. I really wish there weren't as many writing errors as there were. C
 - Ervin, Madison M: Your paper doesn't have a clear thesis statement and that weakens the effect of the essay. Your argument is essentially that if the German people had been told the truth they would have acted differently. the examples from the book suggests that people don't want to hear certain things and block their hearing. Good paper. A
 - Evans, Morgan A: I am really troubled by your paper submission. It is a very nicely written paper. At least in part because you sought help from the writing center. What is troubling is that it is not a paper based on the assignment. The paper was not written for our assignment. That means it was written for some other purpose. I don’t know where the paper came from. It appears that there is a problem with academic honesty in this submission. Please come and talk to me about this paper with the possibility of resubmission -- even thought there would still be a penalty.  
 - Fry, Haley A: Your first paragraph Was simple enough that it ought to have been easy to say clearly what your thesis would be. I take it that what you are going to argue in the paper is that if someone had told the Germans the truth that they would have not pursue the evil that they did. The word enlightenment in the paper assignment meant a period in history that was basically the 17 hundreds. it was a time when rationality and reason was most highly valued. Because you end up arguing that the failure of emotions and values was an equal contributor you're left with a sprawling argument. I felt like I was coming home when you moved in the end to refer to the effective genocide that we inflicted on the Native Americans. clearly your heart sees the agony of all of this. does your argument meat what your heart tells you? B+ 
 - Gardner, Lucy B.: You're opening paragraph leaves me unclear what your position is. do you think that it is a part of human nature to pursue the kind of evil that we see in the Holocaust? I appreciate your use of slavery as a contemporary example. it is both relevant and Powerful. A-
 - Harmon, Kayla A:  There are writing mistakes in your opening paragraph that affect the reader's understanding. You don't give a clear statement in the opening of where you want to go in your essay. evidently it is that you want to argue there was a failure of emotion and values. Later your example seems to be an illustration of a failure of having good information as causing the death of the people in Kenya. Your last statement about these events being unforgivable is itself a huge question but not one that we have addressed either in the class or in your paper. B+
 - Matthews, Bryan L. : I like very much your answer that blame is at the heart of the perpetration of evil. some awkward writing. Your claim about blame is not clearly supported by the illustrations that you give. You don't give any contemporary illustrations of your argument. thank you for your creative and thoughtful response. B
 - Minnich, Parker W: There is some awkward writing that leaves me unclear about how you intend to argue your thesis. Your historical summary is marred by your confusion of the United Nations and the League of Nations. Your examples of Martin Luther and the founding of the United States are intriguing if only because they are not the normal ones that I get in these papers. The structural problem of your paper is really a result of not having a clear Focus but lots of good observations and connections mostly historically-based. B
 - Parker, Sierra L: There are writing errors that should have been caught in a proofreading. Your opening paragraph is confusing and I think it might be because you're not really using your own words. I would suggest you work with the Writing Center on developing your own voice in writing. Towards the end of your paper you finally get with your actual thesis that the evil was a result of a failure of reason as well as emotion and values. This argument is not well supported by what you have written. Your illustration of Rwanda is exactly appropriate well done. C 
 - Patterson, Mary E
 - Senesi, Abigail H: There is awkward writing and errors that should have been caught by proofreading. You are clear enough in stating that your thesis is that fear caused people to not intervene when they could have. You use a good example for a contemporary illustration of Harvey Weinstein's abuse of women. the example allows you to draw a conclusion that might have been included as a part of your thesis. The important observation that silence is a contributing factor and is in effect collusion  is important. Your second submission corrected a number of the problems with your first draft although not all of them.A- 
 - Sims, Riley M: Some spelling and writing errors. They indicate that the paper would have benefited from proofreading. Your thesis is clear enough. You see fear as driving a Corruption of people's emotions and values. I'm left feeling that you didn't elaborate as much as you might have on the Contemporary issue of racism. Clearly there is much more to be sad. It's a good example though. A-
 - Thomas, Tyion M: Quite a number of spelling and writing errors. The fact that you raising your first paragraph that some people deny the existence of the Holocaust suggest strongly that you ought to address that issue in your paper. you don't. And you're opening leaves me uncertain about what your overall thesis is. Clearly your heart is in the right place as you examine the text of the book. Your use of the Contemporary example of racism is of course poignant and Powerful. B-
 - Toney, Courtney M: You're passionate opening paragraph is clear enough about its General depth of feeling. There are some writing errors. there also is no clear thesis at the opening of the paper to allow the reader to know where you're going. Your observation is well made that complicity in the event of the Holocaust can be spread widely. The very passion of your plea for action is an illustration of what we are examining, namely that even with knowledge and even with good intentions, there seems to be a powerful force for evil. I really enjoyed reading your paper. Thank you.A-
 - Williams, Dee (D'Auric) S.: There are vague and awkward grammatical problems. Your opening paragraph is sprawling an introduces many different concepts. Your paper would be much better if you would right and opening paragraph saying clearly where you are going in the paper but only right it after you have finished the rest of the paper. Your state clearly at the last sentence of the paper what you want to conclude. But because you didn't start there it's not clear how the various Dynamics and examples that you have raised as good as they may be fit into the argument you want to make about a failure of  emotion. Your paper demonstrates clearly that you thought a lot about the issues. Thank you. C
 - Wilson, Cooper N: Some awkwardness in your grammar. Your thesis statement is plain and clear good job. The question remains whether reason alone can explain the evil. Thank you for submitting a draft and responding to my suggestions. A

**** With a partner process your journal responses
- Did you come to a clear decision about the nature of the two gatherings?
- Could you identify criteria you used in making your decision?

****  Tools Used in the Study Religion
Religious studies is the attempt to study these things, taking *homo religiosus* seriously

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Textual: study sacred texts 
- Historical: describe origin and development of specific religions 
- Comparative: compare specific types of religious behaviors, beliefs 
- Philosophical: philosophical analysis of religious language and arguments 
- Intellectual & Social History: trace development of religious ideas and institutions over time 


****  Phenomenological Method 
 draws upon all five tools and consists of four steps:

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- *Gathering Data*: observe and describe religious behaviors, speech, beliefs, etc. from the point of view of religious persons and seeking to identify and understand their intentions by 
- *Search for Patterns*: look for common patterns across different religions and religious experiences. 

***** (cont)
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - *Analysis of Patterns* (for their structures): look for universal meanings in patterns that transcend particular religious contexts and recognize diverse meanings (lack of universal meanings) 
 - *Offer Generalizations* about religious patterns and about religion itself. Describe the common forms and elements of religious life and may even take the next step to offer theory or general explanation of the meaning of these patterns and the nature of religion.

***** Brainstorm examples in your group

- 5 examples of religious phenomena
- try to make them different


***** This thing called Phenomenological Method

  A religious phenomenon will only be recognized as such if it is grasped at its own level, that is to say, if it is studied as something religious. To try to grasp the essence of such a phenomenon by means of physiology, sociology, economics, linguistics, art or any other study is false; it misses the one unique and irreducible element in it -- the element of the sacred  (Mircea Eliade, *Patterns in Comparative Religion)*


**** Avoiding reductionism 
while embracing a wide-ranging approach

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Freud understood the close relationship between the study of psychology and religion. Jung would pursue the same phenomena in a different direction 
- Marx and Weber and many others have understood the close interconnection between economic (class) analysis and the phenomena of religion  
- avoiding reductionism while taking seriously the *intentions* of the *homo religiosus* 



**** "What is required is perspective" (p. 8)


 A North American touring the highlands of New Guinea for a visit to one of the tribes living in the outback might well witness men decorated in bird-of-paradise feathers, nude (save for a penis sheath), covered in ashes, and dancing before a fire at the side of which are pigs bound in vines and banana leaves. His or her first reaction might well be to take some photographs in order to show “the folks back home” some  of the exotic aspects of life among primitive peoples. But this picture can be reversed.

***** 

   Suppose the tribesmen of the outback visit a downtown church on Sunday morning. They observe rows of oddly dressed people (what, after all, is the purpose of a necktie?), notice that some sit while others sing, listen to one person speak at length, and see still others pass plates onto which paper and metal disks are placed. What are these tribesmen to think? Where, after all, are the pigs? The fire? The sacred feathers? In both cases, the observer lacks a sense of perspective and context. 
 
***** 
 
   The lesson is a simple one. It is impossible to get at the intention that lies behind religious behavior unless we have a willingness to *enter sympathetically into the cultural worldview of another person*, at least for a moment.

***** Ordering Reality
****** A Notion of Sacred Reality
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - A notion of sacred reality establishes a boundary between religion and non-religion.
   - “Sacred” indicates a reality that is somehow distinct, “set apart,” “other” than ordinary.
   - “Sacred reality” includes the God of the Bible, the Qur’anic Allah, the Brahman of Hinduism, Buddhism’s Nirvana, the kami of Shinto.

****** Manifest in Human Experience
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Although the sacred is “set apart” from the ordinary, it nevertheless may be experienced, thought about, and acted upon. 
   - Thus, all religion has to do with “the element of the sacred” manifesting itself in various ways: in rituals, persons, and natural phenomena. 
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
     - Muslims = the sacred reality (Allah) is made manifest through prophecy
     - Buddhists = the goal of Nirvana “comes to life” in the life and teaching of the Buddha
     - Navaho = the story of the Navaho people makes wisdom available for those who seek harmony between all things.
***** What is Sacred
****** What is Sacred?
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - “Sacred” is a complex word because it is used for a wide range of phenomena: places, time, persons, events, and deities.
   - But, generally, when people speak of something as sacred, they mean to designate the thing in question as “other than ordinary.” 
   - In the broadest sense of the term, the sacred is the “extraordinary.” 
   - The value of using the term “sacred” is that it is not tradition specific.
****** The Sacred and The Holy
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Often the words “sacred” and “holy” are used as equivalents.  
   - Thus, the best way to identify the sacred is to identify that which is designated holy.
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
     - The early Israelites were instructed: “Observe the sabbath day and keep it holy.”
     - A popular Christian hymn begins “Holy, holy, holy, Lord God almighty!” 
     - Islamic tradition refers to Jerusalem as /al-quds—the holy city, or the city set apart/.
***** Examples
****** Examples of the Sacred
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   O God, you are my God, I seek you, my soul thirsts for you; my flesh faints for you, as in a dry and weary land where there is no water. So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary, beholding your power and glory. Because your steadfast love is better than life,my lips will praise You. (Psalm 63:1–3)
   #+END_QUOTE
****** Examples of the Sacred 
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Thou [God] art the Imperishable, the supreme Object of Knowledge, Thou art the ultimate resting-place of this universe; Thou art the immortal guardian of the eternal right; Thou art the everlasting Spirit. . . . Without beginning, middle, or end, of infinite power, Of infinite arms, whose eyes are the moon and sun, I see Thee, whose face is flaming fire, Burning this whole universe with Thy radiance. (11:18–20) [2]
   #+END_QUOTE

   [2] (Bhagavad Gita)
****** Examples of the Sacred 
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   “Its form, O king, cannot be elucidated by similes, but its qualities can. . . . As the lotus is unstained by water, so is Nirvana unstained by all the defilements. . . . As cool water allays feverish heat, so also Nirvana is cool and allays the fever of all the passions. . . . As medicine protects from the torments of poison, so Nirvana protects from the torments of the poisonous passions. . . . Nirvana and medicine both give security. . . . As a mountain peak is unshakeable, so is Nirvana. . . . ” [3]
   #+END_QUOTE

   [3] Buddhism: "The Nature of Nirvana"
***** The Concept in various cultures
****** The Concept of Sacred Reality
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Derived from the Latin “sanctus”.
   - “Sanctus” means “holy” and refers to something separated or set apart from other things.
   - The related terms from the Hebrew (/kadosh/) and the Greek (/hagios/) mean the same.
   - At minimum, the sacred is distinct from the profane.
****** Sacred Reality in Various Cultures
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - In the Bible, God is preeminently sacred or holy, and everyone else and everything else is holy or sacred only in relation to God. 
   - In ancient Rome, sanctus applied as much to the place of certain activities as to the activities themselves. 
     - Those acts that were sanctified were performed in the /fanum or temple; other acts were pro fanum/, that is, performed in front of or outside the temple.
****** Sacred Reality in the Hebrew Bible
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - By contrast, the Hebrew Bible uses /kadosh/ to describe God and things set apart by God’s choice: the people of Israel, the land they live in, types of food, modes of human relations.
   - There is nothing special about such things except that they are chosen by God or are in some kind of relation to God.
***** Sacred and Profane
****** The Sacred and The Ordinary
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - The sacred can further be characterized in terms of “the real.”
   - The sacred stands for that which provides absolute and objective authority to an otherwise relative and subjective existence. 
   - The sacred consists of an entirely different order than the ordinary life of human beings, but is manifest through ordinary existence.
   - Stones, trees, the sky, bodies of water, various people—all these may be the vehicles of the sacred and thus share in its distinctive reality.
****** General Concept of the Sacred
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Sacred reality is present wherever something is *real* by 4 criteria:
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
     - it is "set apart" from everything else in the world
     - it is in some sense beyond human control
     - it is in some sense vital for the well-being of humans
     - it orders human existence

**** 3 patterns of understanding the appearance of the sacred 
 - *Prophetic* (stress on belief, society, and morality—all centered on revelation) Moses.  Mohammed.  A prophet is a person who receives a revelation that deals with historical life of community. 
 - *Sacramental* (stress on sacred objects and ritual as vehicles for the sacred), Jesus. The presence of sacred through an aspect of material reality or objects; stresses role of priests.
 - *Mystical* (stress on states of consciousness, feeling, and experience) the Buddha.  Emphasis on a state of being or consciousness, such as enlightenment or contact with God.

**** these 3 patterns shape how one understands the 4 types of sacred media: 
 - *person—prophet* (prophetic), *God incarnate* (sacramental), and *sage* (mystical), 
 - *objects—texts* (prophetic), bread, wine & material objects (sacramental), breathing & tea (mystical) 
 - *time—linear/historical* (prophetic) v. *cyclical* (often mystical) [sacramental can be either]
 - *space—places of revelations*, places of worship, stupa, and nature (note how all 3 patterns apply)


**** Concepts
 - *Manifest* — to show, reveal, or make known 
 - *Hierophany* — a revelation of the holy, 
 - *Prophet* [one who speaks with the authority of another]: one who speaks with the authority of God or the sacred; a spokesperson for the sacred based upon a received revelation or contact with the sacred.
 - *Sacrament* a sign and instrument of the sacred; a sign that causes or makes effective the reality to which it points
 - *Cosmology*  worldview; an account of the meaning and order of the universe and the relationships between its different parts.



*** Sacred Stories


**** 4 functions 
 - connect with sacred,
 - order cosmos,
 - *traditio*, and
 - ethical


**** Religious language 

 Most often *poetic* in the sense that, like poetry, it *seeks to use ordinary words to convey extraordinary meanings*.


 ![Joseph Campbell](http://baumwollarchives.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/101-3-J-CAMPBELL-top3.jpg)

 Joseph Campbell:

**** Religious Myth: 
 - A story that *sets up a world by describing ultimate reality and its relationship to humanity*.  Myths seek to explain the ultimate meaning of the universe (cosmos) and our existence, its ultimate origins, destiny, order (or disorder) and relationships.  Purpose = revelation of the nature of the sacred, the universe, and human nature.  In short, “How does reality makes sense in light of the sacred?" 
 - Myths seek to *narrate or reveal a transcendent reality* and its relation to ordinary reality.  Mythic time transcends ordinary time.  Mythic events transcend “empirically observable" events.
 - They *do not seek to record simply what happened* in ordinary reality.  They do not aim at empirical or scientific truth (that can be tested via experiments). 


 - Rather myths *represent the collective experience and wisdom of a community over time* concerning the deepest meaning of reality and the ultimate frame of reference for understanding it expressed in the most powerful and fundamental forms of human language—stories conveyed via imaginative, poetic language (exaggeration = frequent vehicle because ordinary language inadequate).  A myth is like a pair of glasses or framework through which people “image" or see the world.
   - Note Well: For one who believes that there is no ultimate meaning to our world, no transcendent reality, or that there is only our immediate experience as known empirically, myth are false or do not exist.


**** Examples of contemporary myths: 

 - The Matrix,
 - Star Wars,
 - Western Movies,
 - Rags to Riches stories,
 - Joe Millionaire (or the one for Mary Millionaire),
 - Extreme Makeover,
 - Desperate Housewives,
 - Car commercials—if you drive this car you will have friends, lovers, wealth, etc. . . .


**** Parable:
 A story that *upsets an existing world or turns it upside down*; makes a point by violating our expectations and calling into questions our assumptions.  It seeks to shock the hearer into seeing ordinary things in a new way, i.e., in light of the sacred reality which is totally “other" than the ordinary and customary.  A parable seeks to move people into a deeper engagement with sacred reality.  *Sacred figures often perform “parabolic actions"* or actions that upset the way things are and open our eyes to a new reality.


 --

**** Examples of Parables/Parabolic Actions
 - Zen koan: "What is the sound of one hand clapping?"
 - A seeker to the Buddha "Are you a god or a magician?"
 - Buddha: "I am not a god or a magician.  I am awake."
 - Awake seems ordinary but it is not.  Greatness can't lie in it.

 --

 - Jesus seeks to open people's eyes to the kingdom of God when he reads from Isaiah 61:1-2 in Luke "The Spirit of the Lord Yahweh is upon me, for he has anointed me to bring glad tidings to the poor.  He has sent me to proclaim liberty to captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free, and to proclaim a year of favor from Yahweh [a jubilee year]" . . . and a day of vengeance for our God . .  Luke 4:18-19
 - Good Samaritan = like the good Al Qaeda terrorist. Our social status does not determine our holiness; but our compassion—even a compassion that violates social customs re: ritual purity.  That is what God wants. 
 - Matthew 25: Whenever you did it to the least of my brothers and sisters you did it to me—Christ is encountered in the needy.  

 --

 - Prodigal Son (Who is lost, the younger or the older son?) or Workers in the Vineyard—those who worked a little get paid the same as those who worked a lot; or Unforgiving debtor. (Luke 15-16)


 ---

**** Canon:
 A *measuring reed or stick, ruler, standard*; list of authoritative texts/scriptures in a tradition

**** Scriptures:
 - Literally "*writings*" (scripture -- "that which is written"), writings considered sacred and authoritative in a particular community.

 --

 - Example: The "*sutra*" (or Pali "sutta"), i.e., a short exposition on a particular teaching of the Buddha, is the basic form of the scriptures in Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism 
 

 ---

**** Theology:
 - Understanding of *reflection on God/sacred/faith*; 
 - "*faith seeking understanding*"
 - Systematic explanation of the meaning of sacred stories and their conceptual relations as well as translation of this meaning in contemporary language.  *Transform story into doctrine that speaks to today's world*.

 --

**** 4 functions of Sacred Stories (including scriptures): 
 - *Connect us to the sacred*: reveal the sacred and provide a vehicle for (or mediate) encounter with the sacred through the imaginative experience and ritual re-enacting of the story; reveal a path to the sacred (e.g. Buddha's journey to enlightenment); provide insight/wisdom re: ultimate truth. 
 - *Order the cosmos*: give an account of the nature, purpose, order, and destiny of the universe, explain how things are related, where things belong, what they mean, how it all fits together ultimately; relate the transcendent reality to the ordinary reality.  

 --

 - *Traditio*: "hand over" a way of life, worldview, set of practices, values, and stories that constitute a community over time from one generation to the next.  Remember truth handed on from the past and bring it to life in the present by helping people to apply it and live it out today.  Continue a way of life and teach it to the next generation.  Tradition—an extended conversation about the meaning of life of a community over time.
 - *Convey an Ethic*: present patterns, models (saints, prophets), and standards of behavior for living in harmony with the sacred order.  E.g. Sunna = the beaten path of the prophet Mohammed.

    - living in a world of a diversity of religions
    - life-long **search**

- Travel to India
****  Hearing his "voice"
"For many years, I have been convinced that the European spirit is on the wane, and is in need of a return to its Asian roots. I have admired Buddha for many years, and have been reading Indian literature since my earliest youth. Later, I became more familiar with Lao Tsu and the other Chinese philosophers“
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

****  Kinds of Stories 
****  Booker's 7 basic types of story plots
<https://tobedwithatrollope.wordpress.com/2007/12/11/the-seven-basic-plots-wh-we-tell-stories-by-christopher-booker/>
****  1-2
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- **Overcoming the Monster** — Stories like Beowulf, ‘Little Red Riding Hood’, Jaws, and many of the James Bond films, where a hero must defeat a monster and restore order to a world that has been threatened by the monster’s presence.
- **Rags to Riches** — These stories feature modest, generally virtuous but downtrodden characters, who achieve a happy ending when their special talents or true beauty is revealed to the world at large. Includes any number of classics such as ‘Cinderella’, David Copperfield, and the Horatio Alger novels.
****  3-4
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- **The Quest** — A hero, often accompanied by sidekicks, travels in search of a priceless treasure and fights against evil and overpowering odds, and ends when he gets both the treasure and the girl. The Odyssey is a classic example of this kind of story.
- **Voyage and Return** — Alice in Wonderland, Robinson Crusoe on his desert island, other stories of normal protagonists who are suddenly thrust into strange and alien worlds and must make their way back to normal life once more.
****  5-7
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- **Comedy** — Not always synonymous with humour. Instead, the plot of a comedy involves some kind of confusion that must be resolved before the hero and heroine can be united in love. Think of Shakespeare’s comedies, The Marriage of Figaro, the plays of Oscar Wilde and Gilbert and Sullivan, and even War and Peace.
- **Tragedy** — As a rule, the terrible consequences of human overreaching and egotism. The Picture of Dorian Gray, Julius Caesar, Anna Karenina…this category is usually self-evident.
- **Rebirth** — The stories of Ebeneezer Scrooge and Mary Lennox would fall into this basic plot type, which focuses on a threatening shadow that seems nearly victorious until a sequence of fortuitous (or even miraculous) events lead to redemption and rebirth, and the restoration of a happier world.
****  Hesse (2)
****  Religion is/is not
**** first, religion is **not**:
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-   necessarily monotheistic,
-   necessarily a body of moral rules
-   necessarily a belief in the supernatural, heaven, hell, or even life after death
-   necessarily an explanation of the origins of creation.
**** # Religion **is**:
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-   notion of sacred reality
-   orders and brings understanding to human existence
-   has lasting effect on thinking, feeling, acting
**** # 5 Themes of Siddhartha
 Write on a piece of  paper an example from text of:
1. Self-realization
2. Personal experience vs. Formal training
3. Persistence
4. Folly of materialism or less is more
5. paradox of unreal reality (reality is an illusion)
**** # With a partner discuss:
1. most important illustration of the theme from the text
2. How important was that theme in the context of the whole work
3. What does the theme tell us about religion?

    In American courts, raising the right hand, swearing on the Bible, and reciting an oath signifies the obligation to tell the truth.
In everyday life we participate in numerous personal rituals.
- Shaking hands as a sign of mutual trust
- Standing in honor of a particular person

#+END_NOTES

****** Examples?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - Give an example of a ritual that orders your interaction with others.
 - What is a ritual that has important meaning for you and your friends or family?  Explain.
 - How does ritual help us to understand the ways that religion is more than a set of beliefs?
 - What are the best arguments for and against the following claim: “Religion begins with ritual and it remains ritual before it is anything else.”
 - How can ritual go wrong?  What happens when it goes right?

*****  Ritual in Religious Contexts
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - Ritual plays an important role in every religious tradition.
 - Some religions are famous for their ritual character.
   - Roman Catholicism
   - Russian Orthodoxy
 - Other religions are known for their resistance to ritual, but even these religions have certain stylized forms of behavior that are rituals.
   - Society of Friends (Quakers)

******  Mythos and Ritual
  - One of the most common forms of ritual involves acting out or dramatizing religious stories.
 The conjunction of myth and ritual serves as a way for people to participate in the creative power of the sacred.

 #+BEGIN_NOTES
 In many tribal societies people not only remember the tribal myths but also live them and act them out.

 #+END_NOTES

******  Ritual Reenactment
  In tribal societies, creation stories may be ritualized through dance and gesture at particular times of the year so that people reenact - the first deeds of gods and goddesses.
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - The Greek tragedy is derived from the ritualized worship of the Dionysus.
  - The modern drama derives from the acting out of the Easter story in French monasteries during the Middle Ages.
******  The Passover
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - The *Passover* meal is also called the seder, a Hebrew word that means “order” or “arrangement.”
  Commemorates the meal eaten by the Jews as the were delivered from slavery
 -  Retelling the story of the *Exodus* is central to the meal
 -  The *Passover* meal is not merely a historical remembrance.
 -  For Jews participating in the Passover meal, there is a combination of memory, worship, and hope.
 -  To celebrate the Passover is to become ritually one with those who first observed it before leaving Egypt.
 -  Thus, Jews celebrate an ancient story in their tradition by reenacting the story in a highly ritualized fashion

 #+BEGIN_NOTES

   Note:
   - At Passover, Jews all over the world gather in their homes to share a formal meal involving the eating of symbolic foods, various readings and prayers, and a number of blessings.
   - The meal is orchestrated by the head of the household, who conducts it according to well established traditions.
   - Passover commemorates the meal eaten by the Jews the evening before they left Egypt and the enslavement of their people in order to journey toward, and eventually reach, the Promised Land.
   - Central to the Passover meal are the great events described in the Bible in the book of Exodus.
   - One of the high points of the meal comes when the youngest person present at the table asks why the meal is eaten. The response comes in the form of a reading from the haggadah.

 #+END_NOTES
******  Holy Communion
   *Holy Communion* in Christianity functions in ways that are analogous to the *Passover* in Judaism.
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - The various Christian communities give diverse interpretations of the significance of communion.
   - However, all Christian groups agree that when they celebrate the communion meal, they are reenacting events connected with Jesus of Nazareth.
   - Holy Communion is a ritual reenactment of this story.
   - Like the Passover meal, the celebration of Holy Communion carries a meaning that the community of believers, long after the event itself, wishes to restate.
#+BEGIN_NOTES
   - The gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, as well as the letter of Paul known as First Corinthians, describe a ceremony involving the use of bread and wine, which are given significance through words attributed to Jesus.

#+END_NOTES
******  Other examples of  Religious Rituals
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - In *Shi’a Islam*, the “passion plays” of the month of Muharram reenact the martyrdom of Husayn at Karbala in 692 C.E. and draw members of the Shi’i community into an eternal drama in which good suffers in its struggle with evil.
   - In Shinto, the rituals performed at shrines throughout Japan reenact the conflict between Amaterasu (the sun goddess) and Susanoo (the god of storms) and enable participants to feel themselves a part of the struggle to bring order to the world.
*****  Rites of Passage
 - Rites of passage describe those ceremonies associated with the transitional moments in a person’s life.
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
All religions provide rituals of some sort or another
Rituals may be turned to be for *nominal* believers to observe customs of tradition (e.g. weddings)
*All rites of passage have three phases—separation, liminal, and reintegration.*


#+BEGIN_NOTES
 Note:
 - All religions provide rituals and/or theological rationales to commemorate such moments.
 - Even nominal believers who feel no great need to observe most of the customs of a tradition may still turn to religion for rites of passage.

#+END_NOTES
******  Types of rituals
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - Birth rituals
 - Rites of Initiation
 - Rituals of Mourning & Death
 - Rites of passage of time, e.g. cycle of the year, cycle of seasons

******  Birth Rituals
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Although some traditional cultures actually ritualize the moment of birth, “birth rituals” usually refer to rites connected to the newborn and its parents.
  - For Jews and Muslims, circumcision initiates male children into the religious community.
  - In Christian communities, baptism makes the child a member of the Christian church.
  - Hindus use a ritualized feeding to initiate a male member into the duties of his caste.
  - Similar meanings are given to birth rituals in the various religious traditions, even though the forms are quite diverse.
  - People celebrate the safe passage of the infant from the womb into the world; they welcome him or her into the family; they give the child a name; they pay homage to the creative power of the sacred.
******  Rituals of Initiation
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Rituals of initiation celebrate and symbolize the passage of a person from childhood into adulthood.
  - While the specifics of this rite varied in different cultures, the outlines of the ceremony remained rather constant: 
      - ritual segregation from the larger group and some form of testing
      - the actual ceremonies of initiation
      - reentry into the group as a recognized adult
******  Initiation Rites in Postmodern Society
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - In contemporary society, many young people go through a traditional rite of passage, but the “adults” are not really adults for some time after their “passage.”
  - Today, the most common ritual of initiation is marriage.
  - Many elements of the marriage rite hearken back to ancient rituals.
******  Rituals of Mourning and Death
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Different religious traditions ritualize the mourning process in various ways.
      - Taoist rites include an elaborate ritual involving an enactment of the soul’s journey into the underworld and its rescue and delivery into heaven by ancestral spirits.
  - Many burial rites symbolize the relationship of human beings to the natural world.
      - Pious Hindus in India cremate their dead and consign the ashes to the river Ganges as a sign of the never-ending cycle of life and death.
******  Rituals of Mourning and Death
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Funeral rites are intended to accomplish different ends in different cultures.
  - To aid the spirits of the dead to journey through the afterworld either by providing symbolic gifts for them (ancient Egyptians and native peoples of North America).
  - To provide living “guides” for the dead (Taoism).
  - To help the souls of the dead to purge sin (Roman Catholicism and Orthodoxy).
******  Temporal Rites and Celebrations
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - The observance of cycles of time has been a central characteristic of most, if not all, historic religious traditions.
  - For people who hunted, gathered, or planted, the cycle of the seasons was crucial to life.  As a result, great celebrations and rituals were associated with the change of the seasons.
  - Even in modern industrial societies, many of the great festivals continue to take place in conjunction with the change of the seasons.
*****  Religious Meanings of Ritual
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - Ritual is so closely identified with formal worship that one can generally say that the ends of ritual are the ends of worship.
 - Traditionally speaking, worship promotes one of these four ends or purposes, or a combination of them: 
     - Adoration
     - Thanksgiving
     - Petition
     - Penance/purification
******  Adoration
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Basically, adoration means acknowledgment of the sovereignty of the Sacred over the person.
  - Adoration means the acknowledgment that one is not self-sufficient, but dependent.
  - In religions with a personal, transcendent God, there are basic ritual gestures assumed in moments of prayer that dramatically illustrate the concept of adoration.
  - In religions without a transcendent deity, the focus is on the search for enlightenment and the primary gesture of adoration is meditative.
******  Thanksgiving
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Because one of the basic insights of many religious traditions is that the world and all its bounty flow from the world of the sacred, it is only fitting that such traditions emphasize the need to acknowledge that gift.
  - The most common form of thanksgiving is the ritual act of giving a gift. Such donations may run from the formal act of a sacrifice, to the leaving of a gift at an altar or shrine

**** The Problem of Evil

 - The word theodicy derives from the Greek words


***** Θεός Τheos and δίκη dikē. 
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - "God" + "Justice"
  - http://youtu.be/qqzF2aRVJAc Elie Wiesel
    - we must remember
    - the challenge


*****  *What is the Problem of Evil?*
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - actually a cluster of "problems" related to understanding *Sacred reality*
  - Why does good fortune turn to bad? (*Psalms*)
  - Why do the righteous suffer and the wicked flourish? (*Hindu*)

#+BEGIN_NOTES
  Note:
  - The problem of evil actually represents not a single problem but a cluster of issues arising from the attempt to relate a diverse set of experiences to notions of sacred reality.
  - Drawing on the tradition of his faith community, for example, the psalmist asks, in effect, Why does good fortune turn to bad?
  - In a very different context, a critic of Hindu beliefs asks a different sort of question: Why do the righteous suffer and the wicked flourish?
#+END_NOTES    

***** Logical dilemma

  - In religious traditions that stress the power and goodness of one God who rules over all creation, the existence of evil presents a logical dilemma.
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
	  - If God is good and powerful, what is the nature of evil?
	  - If God could prevent evil but does not, can God be good?
	  - On the other hand, if God is good but cannot prevent evil, can God be powerful?


***** Problem of Evil (Christianity)

  *We have heard with our ears, O God, our ancestors have told us, what deeds you performed in their days, in the days of old; you with your own hand drove out the nations. . . . Yet you have rejected us and abased us, and have not gone out with our armies. You made us turn back from the foe, and our enemies have gotten spoil*. (Psalm 44:12a, 910)


***** Problem of Evil Hinduism

  *The world is so confused and out of joint, why does Brahma not set it straight? If he is master of the whole world, Brahma, lord of the many beings born, why in the whole world did he ordain misfortune? Why did he not make the whole world happy? . . .Why did he make the world with deception, lies, and excess, with injustice?*


**** Theodicy
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - God is all-merciful. God is all-powerful. God is perfect-justice.
 - Any 2 of these can be held at the same time - but not all 3
 - even non-theists must explain the presence of evil & suffering (cf. e.g. a psychologists perspective: http://www.gurteen.com/gurteen/gurteen.nsf/id/X0038E2E2/


#+BEGIN_NOTES
 Note:
 - When the problem of evil is raised in connection with belief in God or gods, we may describe them as issues of *theodicy*, or divine justice.
 - However, even those religious traditions that stress the impersonal nature of the sacred, must seek to explain the existence of evil or suffering in the world.

[[../../Auschwitz-main-gate.jpg]]

***** 

 For Jews the challenge of a God of history, with a plan – for Christians: Where was Christ? 
[[../../auschwitz14.jpg]]


#+BEGIN_NOTES
 Note:
 - For Jews, the challenge of the Holocaust involves the relationship of the destruction of Europe’s Jews to the notion that there is a God who governs history according to a plan and that all the events of Jewish history have a meaning in the plan of God. 
 - For Christians, the problem is slightly different and involves the following question: In the death camps, where was Christ?

#+END_NOTES



***** The Holocaust (Shoah)
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - In the modern West, no single experience raises the questions associated with the problem of evil with greater power than the *Holocaust*.
  - The *Holocaust* illustrates the general point of how religious people identify evil in terms of a contradiction between the facts of experience and the reality of the sacred.
  - The *Holocaust* challenges some of the central affirmations of Jewish and Christian faith.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
  Note:
  - For Jews, the challenge of the Holocaust involves the relationship of the destruction of Europes Jews to the notion that there is a God who governs history according to a plan and that all the events of Jewish history have a meaning in the plan of God.
  - For Christians, the problem is slightly different and involves the following question: In the death camps, where was Christ?

**** 4 Responses to the Problem of Evil
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 1. *Karma*
 2. *Consolation of Promise*
 3. *Appeal to Sovereignty*
 4. *Dualism*

***** Responses to the Problem of Evil: Karma

  *Evil and Karma: The Indian Context*

   *Karma*, signifies the moral weight of one’s actions 
   people get what they deserve (at least over the long haul) 

#+BEGIN_NOTES
  Note:
  - *Karma*, signifies the moral weight of one’s actions. Good or proper action results in good karma and in progress toward the goal of enlightenment.
  - In connection with the problem of evil, *karma* is a kind of inexorable reality that explains the destiny of human beings. People get what they deserve at least, over the long cycle of time.
  - The inexorability of *karma* is the problem addressed in the Buddhist story of The Death of Moggallana.

#+END_NOTES


***** Buddhist Perspective on Evil

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - *Evil is located in the self*, with its passions and desires.
   cruelty & pain are not simply luck of the draw
  - not the *will of God*
  - solution to the problem of evil *depends on each individual*  

#+BEGIN_NOTES
  Note:
  - The brute facts of cruelty and pain are not simply the luck of the draw, nor are they connected with the will of God.
  - One who attains enlightenment knows that the resolution of the experiences associated with evil does not depend on gods or goddesses, nor does it depend on other human beings.
  - In the fundamental sense, the solution to the problem of evil depends on each individual person.

#+END_NOTES


***** Reponses to the Problem of Evil: Consolation

  *The Consolation of Promise*
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - At some future time, evil will be overcome, justice will be satisfied, and the point of suffering will be made clear.
  - Such a response uses the language of promise, offering consolation and hope to those currently suffering.
  - Just how or when the promise will be fulfilled is a matter on which there is a variety of opinions.


***** Jewish Perspective on Evil
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Jews wait for a *Messiah who is yet to come*.
  - When the anointed one arrives, he will reestablish the nation of Israel and will rule the other nations with a rod of iron.
  - some Orthodox groups oppose the nation of Israel *because the Messiah has not yet come.*
#+BEGIN_NOTES
  Note:
  - It is significant that a number of Orthodox groups hold that the contemporary state of Israel is not a fulfillment of this promise.
  - Rather, they view the Jewish state as a violation of the Torah, a manifestation of the impatience and disobedience of humanity rather than the work of God.

#+END_NOTES


***** Christian Response to Evil
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Christianity holds that the *Messiah has come*: Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah.
  - His life, death, and resurrection manifest the promise of God to bring about a peaceable kingdom.
  - The work of Jesus is not yet complete, however. For, he will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead; and his reign will have no end.
  - The doctrine of the *parousia* or the second coming of Christ indicates that the fulfillment of the promise is yet to come.


***** Muslim Response to Evil
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Islam also embodies the promise theme common to Judaism and Christianity.
  - An idea appears in the Islamic tradition that the *mahdi* will come or appear at the time God decides and will establish the rule of justice and equity on earth.
  - Islam also refers to an afterlife in which *good will be rewarded, evil punished, and suffering explained.*
  - Through a *Day of Resurrection and Judgment, God will resolve the problem of evil.*


***** Reponses to the Problem of Evil: Appeal to Sovereignty
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - The sovereignty appeal finds its power in affirming that, at least from the human standpoint, there are no solutions to the problem of evil.
  - The book of *Job* may be taken as the archetype of the sovereignty response. As such, it has both baffled and comforted believers throughout generations of Jewish and Christian faith. 


***** The Story of Job
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - God tests Jobs faith to see if his obedience to God is motivated by his own integrity or desire for personal gain.
   - Job rejects the idea that his suffering is for his education or to make him better
   - Job also rejects the idea that his suffering is in proportion to some sin he has committed.
   - In the end, God claims the wisdom of the creator of all things and Job accepts the finitude of human understanding and the sovereignty of the maker of heaven and earth. 


***** Responses to the Problem of Evil: *Dualism* 

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Evil is the result of a conflict between good and evil powers, *both of which share some of the characteristics of sacred reality.*
  - From the perspective of dualism, *God is good but God's sovereignty faces a severe challenge from those powers that do evil in the world.*
  - Many religious traditions embody elements of dualism, but the best example is in *Zoroastrianism.* 


***** Zoroastrian Response to Evil
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Struggle between *Spenta Mainyu* (beneficent spirit) and *Angra Mainyu* (hostile spirit), whose conflict stems from the beginning of all things and continues to the end of time.
  - *Spenta Mainyu* and *Angra Mainyu* are twins, offspring of the wise lord *Ahura Mazda*, the creator of all things.
  - *Ahura Mazdas* twins represent the moral choice set before all creatures. Evil comes into the world as a result of wrongful choice, and the proper response is thus to fight against it.


***** Evaluating Responses to the Problem of Evil
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Are the answers adequate?
  - Are the answers logical? 
  - Are the answers coherent? 
  - Are the answers psychologically satisfying? 
  - What are the moral consequences?

 And in their footsteps We sent Jesus the son of Mary, confirming the Law that had come before him: We sent him the Gospel: therein was guidance and light, and confirmation of the Law that had come before him: a guidance and an admonition to those who fear Allah.
 Let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah hath revealed therein. If any do fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah hath revealed, they are (no better than) those who rebel.

**** Continued 
 To thee We sent the Scripture in truth, confirming the scripture that came before it, and guarding it in safety: so judge between them by what Allah hath revealed, and follow not their vain desires, diverging from the Truth that hath come to thee. To each among you have we prescribed a law and an open way. If Allah had so willed, He would have made you a single people, but (His plan is) to test you in what He hath given you: so strive as in a race in all virtues. The goal of you all is to Allah; it is He that will show you the truth of the matters in which ye dispute;

 No one knows that you’re fasting, so its done ONLY for the sake of Allah (swt)
 Prophets and fasting )i.e David and how it gets you closer to Allah (swT)

*** Islam & Muslim
     	             ISLAM    =   Religion

		 MUSLIM   =   Follower of Islam

*** A few Misconceptions
 Islam and Culture

 Muslims and Arabs

 Status of Women

 Concept of Jihad

 Belief in Jesus

 Does the media play a role in these misconceptions?

*** Islam & Culture
 What’s the difference?
 Multiple cultures; Same beliefs


*** Muslims and Arabs
 Muslim Population 1.6 - 1.8 Billion

 Largest population of Muslims is in 
 Indonesia, India and China

 Arabs only constitute 15-20% of Muslims

 90-95% of Arabs are Muslims

*** Status of Women
 “Prior to Islam, a woman was regarded by her parents as a threat to family honor and hence worthy of burial alive at infancy. As an adult, she was a sex object that could be bought, sold and inherited. From this position of inferiority and legal incapacity, Islam raised women to a position of influence and prestige in family and society.”
 Cultural Atlas of Islam 
 Equal vs. Identical
 Examples of Rights 1400 years ago
 Concept of Hijab (Covering)
 Marriage of the Prophet Mohammad (pbuh)
 Written on the slide: The Kaabah was built by Abraham and Ishmael as the first place for people to worship the one God.
 Video of Hajj: during prayer

 32

*** Concept of Jihad
 Different Forms of Jihad
 Establishment of Justice
 Rules of Engagement
 “Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress. Indeed, Allah does not like transgressors” 
 Qur’an 2:190



 “History makes it clear however, that the legend of fanatical Muslims sweeping through the world and forcing Islam at the point of the sword upon conquered races is one of the most fanatically absurd myths that historians have ever repeated”
 De Lacy O’Leary – Islam at the Crossroads


 Include Audio of the Qur’an – Surat Al Fatiha

 - This is a 700 year old copy of the Qur’an belonging to Sultan Baybar
 33

 Status in Islam 
 Miracles 
 Did he die?

  “The similitude of Jesus before Allah is as that of Adam He created him from dust then said to him be and he was”
 Qur’an 3: 59
*** Jesus (pbuh)
 Some actions of cultures don’t represent the teachings of Islam
 Pictures of different hijabs (african, arab, etc…)
 34

*** Shariah
 Society
 Economics
 Character of Muslims

 In Islam, faith is not an abstract theological dogma, nor an intellectual creed, nor a philosophical proposition... It is the Shari`ah which translates faith and moral ideals into clear, definable, viable, and concrete goals, forms, and codes, and brings them within the grasp of every ordinary man and woman; this is why it is one of the greatest blessings of God and one of the greatest vehicles for human progress. 
 Khurram Murad


 Bolded & underlined text
 Maybe take out the writing under each section (just keep quran and sunnah – that’s it) the rest should be speaking points.

  Maybe title it “Where does it come from?”

 35

*** Recap slide
 Belief in One God (Allah)
 Prophet Muhammad was the Final Messenger
 Qur’an is the Final & Preserved Revelation
 Purpose of life is to Worship Allah
 Islam is a Way of Life

*** HADITH
 Sayings of the Prophet Muhammad
 “The world is green and beautiful, and God has appointed you His stewards over it.”
 "Seeking knowledge is obligatory upon every Muslim (Male and Female).“
 “God will show no compassion on the one who has no compassion towards all humankind.”
 “God does not look upon your bodies and appearance, He looks  upon your hearts and your deeds.”

*** HADITH
 “The most perfect in faith amongst Muslim men is he who is best in manner and kindest to his wife.”

 “He who eats his fill while his neighbor goes without food is not a believer.”

** Religion & Morality

*** What is the relationship between Religion & Morality

**** US & religion
 - Reagan: politics & morality linked
 - 3 issues:
   - religion providing *foundation* for morality
   - definitions: *ethics*, *morality*, *sacred* (morality having to do with *human welfare* & religion having to do with *sacred*)
 - Which takes priority? religion? morality? (Kierkegaard's focus on Abraham & Isaac, set sacrifice his son per God's command
*** Justification

**** Deontological 
 - ask what is one's *duty*
 - What one *ought* to do in certain circumstances
 - based on *principle*
**** Teleological
 - asking *what are the consequences* of this action
 - what is the *end* or final result from this action? (intended or unintended)
**** Rule based? or Act based?
 - each of these arguments can focus on *rules*
 - or on *acts*
*** 3 case studies
**** Hinduism & caste system
 - oldest *Vedic* hinduism based on the social order of caste system
 - newer *Upanishads* focused on individuals, universal Brahman and the release (*moksha*) from endless cycle of birth & death
 - religion & morality in *tension* with one another
**** Islam & war (jihad)
 - Islam born under the burden of persecution -- Quran approves the use of force when one is wronged
 - while war not to be undertaken lightly, religious justification for war (cautious)
 - *jihad* is *struggle* to expand Islam
 - religion *complementing* and filling out morality
**** Christianity & prayer
 - Pray because we are *commanded to*?
 - Pray because it provides *good results*?
 - both?
 - religion *animating* the moral life

** Discussion questions doc from Beacon Press on Tent of Abraham
*** Questions for Discussion
 /Read pp. 3-27, 191-196, and pp.207-218./
 *[125-174 = Muslim midrash]*

 - Compare the two versions of the story of the families of Abraham. What are your reactions to each? Do you feel drawn to asserting that one version must be true and the other false?
 - Is it possible that each story shows partial truths, each adding perspective to the other and to the nature of human relationships overall? Can a single coherent story be created using details from each?
 - After reading the final essay in the book "Why Hagar Left," which introduces a different stance entirely, what do you consider to be the truth?
 - Try reading the stories with people of a different religion. How do your reactions differ? How are they the same?
 - Now read the stories with people from your same religion. Do you still find a variety of perspectives or do you all feel the same?
*** For the essays on pp. 29-78. (Jewish Midrash)

 - What issues are raised for you by this essay? Are your ideas about sibling rivalry and cooperation, the effects of death on family relationships, the nature of owning land, the meaning of sacrificing what we hold most dear, or other life-questions, affected by reading this essay?
 - Do these ancient stories apply to conflicts in the modern world, such as that between the Israelis and the Palestinians, or are they irrelevant?
*** For the essays on pp. 79-124. (Christian Midrash)

 - What do you think of the reports of cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian women? Can an analogy be drawn between the stories of war-fighting and peacemaking in the Bible's Abrahamic saga and those processes today?
 - Imagine yourself in conversation with people from a society that is in deep conflict with your own. Who would set it up? What would you want to say? What goals would you have for the first meeting? The tenth?
*** For the essays from pp. 80-124.

 - Did you find these essay's efforts to take public and interpersonal events and translate them into inner spiritual and emotional processes effective?
 - Can you imagine new ceremonies, celebrations, or forms of prayer and meditation being created from these stories?
 - Would it make sense to draw from these psycho-spiritual lessons to make new patterns in our national and political lives?
*** For the essay on pp. 183-190.

 - Would you be interested on organizing a "Tent of Peace" as it is described in the essay? What changes would you make? Do you know people who would join in an Abrahamic invitation?
 - Are there public actions - e.g. a statement or action on war and peace, an interreligious action on the global climate crisis, a program for shared observance of sacred seasons or for shared interreligious study of these or other sacred texts or shared prayer services or shared community-service projects - that you feel drawn to do after reading the book?

10.  What is Haolam Emes?  How does Josek use this concept to answer Simon’s dilemma?
11. What does Arthur mean when he says, “A superman has asked a sub-human to do something which is superhuman”?  Answer hinges on understanding the Nazi concept of Übermenschen and Untermenschen.

13.  According to Simon, how did the native Poles feel about the Jews?
14.  What has happened to the SS man?  What does the nurse give Simon?  What is his reaction?
15.  Read carefully Arthur’s “speech” to Simon beginning with “If we survive this camp” to “We are indulging in a luxury...”.  Discuss in detail Arthur’s philosophy about what is wrong or out of sync with the world at this time.
