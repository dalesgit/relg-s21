 Shammai


Hillel the Elder's friendly adversary was Shammai, a native of the Land
of Israel about whom little is known except that he was a builder, known
for the strictness of his views. He was reputed to be quick-tempered and
impatient. Both lived during the reign of King Herod (37-4 BCE), an
oppressive period in Jewish history because of the Roman occupation of
the Land of Israel. Shammai was concerned that if Jews had too much
contact with the Romans, the Jewish community would be weakened, and
this attitude was reflected in his strict interpretation of Jewish law.
Hillel did not share Shammai's fear and therefore was more liberal in
his view of law.
#+END_NOTES

*** Hillel


*On the "Golden Rule"* Once there was a gentile who came before Shammai,
and said to him: "Convert me on the condition that you teach me the
whole Torah while I stand on one foot. Shammai pushed him aside with the
measuring stick he was holding. The same fellow came before Hillel, and
Hillel converted him, saying: That which is despicable to you, do not do
to your fellow, this is the whole Torah, and the rest is commentary, go
and learn it." - *Babylonian Talmud*, /Shabbat 31a/

Notes:

*If Not Now, When?* "If I am not for myself, then who will be for me?
And if I am only for myself, then what am I? And if not now, when?"


*On Time for Study* "Do not say: 'When I have leisure I shall study,'
perhaps you will never have leisure."

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Notes:
Ask what are the pillars in Judaism & Christianity?

- "The Meccan suras of the Quran have a dramatic eschatological emphasis" (apocalyptic)
- Clearly the "redaction" of the Quran as we have it today took some time after Muhammad's death, it is still relatively little understood
- Islam became quickly an **urban** religion, "and so a scribal and literary one."
