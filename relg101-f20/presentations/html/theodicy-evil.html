<li>Why do the righteous suffer and the wicked flourish? (<b>Hindu</b>)</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Note: - The problem of evil actually represents not a single problem but a cluster of issues arising from the attempt to relate a diverse set of experiences to notions of sacred reality. - Drawing on the tradition of his faith community, for example, the psalmist asks, in effect, Why does good fortune turn to bad? - In a very different context, a critic of Hindu beliefs asks a different sort of question: Why do the righteous suffer and the wicked flourish?

<h3 id="logical-dilemma">Logical dilemma</h3>
<ul>
<li>In religious traditions that stress the power and goodness of one God who rules over all creation, the existence of evil presents a logical dilemma.

<ul>
<li>If God is good and powerful, what is the nature of evil?</li>
<li>If God could prevent evil but does not, can God be good?</li>
<li>On the other hand, if God is good but cannot prevent evil, can God be powerful?</li>

<i>We have heard with our ears, O God, our ancestors have told us, what deeds you performed in their days, in the days of old; you with your own hand drove out the nations. . . . Yet you have rejected us and abased us, and have not gone out with our armies. You made us turn back from the foe, and our enemies have gotten spoil</i>. (Psalm 44:12a, 910)

If he is master of the whole world, Brahma, lord of the many beings born, why in the whole world did he ordain misfortune?

<li>God is all-merciful. God is all-powerful. God is perfect-justice.</li>
<li>Any 2 of these can be held at the same time - but not all 3</li>
<li>even non-theists must explain the presence of evil &amp; suffering (cf. e.g. a psychologists perspective: <a href="http://www.gurteen.com/gurteen/gurteen.nsf/id/X0038E2E2/">Scott Peck</a>)</li>

<p>
Note: - When the problem of evil is raised in connection with belief in God or gods, we may describe them as issues of <b>theodicy</b>, or divine justice. - However, even those religious traditions that stress the impersonal nature of the sacred, must seek to explain the existence of evil or suffering in the world.

Note: - For Jews, the challenge of the Holocaust involves the relationship of the destruction of Europe's Jews to the notion that there is a God who governs history according to a plan and that all the events of Jewish history have a meaning in the plan of God. - For Christians, the problem is slightly different and involves the following question: In the death camps, where was Christ?

<p>
Note: - <b>Karma</b>, signifies the moral weight of one's actions. Good or proper action results in good karma and in progress toward the goal of enlightenment. - In connection with the problem of evil, <b>karma</b> is a kind of inexorable reality that explains the destiny of human beings. People get what they deserve at least, over the long cycle of time. - The inexorability of <b>karma</b> is the problem addressed in the Buddhist story of The Death of Moggallana.

</ul>


<aside class="notes">
<p>

</p>

<p>
Note: - The brute facts of cruelty and pain are not simply the luck of the draw, nor are they connected with the will of God. - One who attains enlightenment knows that the resolution of the experiences associated with evil does not depend on gods or goddesses, nor does it depend on other human beings. - In the fundamental sense, the solution to the problem of evil depends on each individual person.

<h2 id="reponses-to-the-problem-of-evil">The Consolation of Promise</h2>
<ul>
<li>At some future time, evil will be overcome, justice will be satisfied, and the point of suffering will be made clear.</li>
<li>Such a response uses the language of promise, offering consolation and hope to those currently suffering.</li>
<li>Just how or when the promise will be fulfilled is a matter on which there is a variety of opinions.</li>

<h3 id="jewish-perspective-on-evil">Consolation of Promise: Jewish</h3>
<ul>
<li>Jews wait for a <b>Messiah who is yet to come</b>.</li>
<li>When the anointed one arrives, he will reestablish the nation of Israel and will rule the other nations with a rod of iron.</li>
<li>some Orthodox groups oppose the nation of Israel <b>because the Messiah has not yet come.</b></li>

</ul>


<aside class="notes">
<p>

</p>

<p>
Note: - It is significant that a number of Orthodox groups hold that the contemporary state of Israel is not a fulfillment of this promise. - Rather, they view the Jewish state as a violation of the Torah, a manifestation of the impatience and disobedience of humanity rather than the work of God.

<ul>
<li>Christianity holds that the <b>Messiah has come</b>: Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah.</li>
<li>His life, death, and resurrection manifest the promise of God to bring about a peaceable kingdom.</li>
<li>The work of Jesus is not yet complete, however. For, he will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead; and his reign will have no end.</li>
<li>The doctrine of the <b>parousia</b> or the second coming of Christ indicates that the fulfillment of the promise is yet to come.</li>

<li>Islam also embodies the promise theme common to Judaism and Christianity.</li>
<li>An idea appears in the Islamic tradition that the <b>mahdi</b> will come or appear at the time God decides and will establish the rule of justice and equity on earth.</li>
<li>Islam also refers to an afterlife in which <b>good will be rewarded, evil punished, and suffering explained.</b></li>
<li>Through a <b>Day of Resurrection and Judgment, God will resolve the problem of evil.</b></li>

<h2 id="reponses-to-the-problem-of-evil-1">Appeal to Sovereignty</h2>
<ul>
<li>The sovereignty appeal finds its power in affirming that, at least from the human standpoint, there are no solutions to the problem of evil.</li>
<li>The book of <b>Job</b> may be taken as the archetype of the sovereignty response. As such, it has both baffled and comforted believers throughout generations of Jewish and Christian faith.</li>

<h3 id="the-story-of-job">Appeal to Sovereignty: Story of Job</h3>
<ul>
<li>God tests Jobs faith to see if his obedience to God is motivated by his own integrity or desire for personal gain.</li>
<li>Job rejects the idea that his suffering is for his education or to make him better</li>
<li>Job also rejects the idea that his suffering is in proportion to some sin he has committed.</li>
<li>In the end, God claims the wisdom of the creator of all things and Job accepts the finitude of human understanding and the sovereignty of the maker of heaven and earth.</li>

<h2 id="responses-to-the-problem-of-evil-2">Dualism</h2>
<ul>
<li>Evil is the result of a conflict between good and evil powers, <b>both of which share some of the characteristics of sacred reality.</b></li>
<li>From the perspective of dualism, <b>God is good but God's sovereignty faces a severe challenge from those powers that do evil in the world.</b></li>
<li>Many religious traditions embody elements of dualism, but the best example is in <b>Zoroastrianism.</b></li>

<section id="slide-zoroastrian-response-to-evil">
<h3 id="zoroastrian-response-to-evil">Dualism: Zoroastrian</h3>
<ul>
<li>Struggle between <b>Spenta Mainyu</b> (beneficent spirit) and <b>Angra Mainyu</b> (hostile spirit), whose conflict stems from the beginning of all things and continues to the end of time.</li>
<li><b>Spenta Mainyu</b> and <b>Angra Mainyu</b> are twins, offspring of the wise lord <b>Ahura Mazda</b>, the creator of all things.</li>
<li><b>Ahura Mazdas</b> twins represent the moral choice set before all creatures. Evil comes into the world as a result of wrongful choice, and the proper response is thus to fight against it.</li>
