<dt>(God) "Elohim"</dt><dd>is another name used for God. It is a plural form of the older name for God "el".</dd>
<dt>yhwh יהןה</dt><dd>(Yahweh or LORD) This is the holy name of God; cf. Exodus 3, where Moses learns about this name, although it had been used from the beginning of the text of Genesis. By the time of Jesus, it was no longer pronounced.</dd>

<dt>adonai אדני</dt><dd>(Lord) This is the ordinary hebrew word which would have referred to a person. The name "Jehovah" was mistakenly derived from combining the vowels of the word "adonai" with the consonants of the tetragrammaton "yhwh". <b>HaShem</b> is used when even saying "adonai" is too holy to speak.</dd>
<dt>Allāh الله</dt><dd>from ancient times the name for "God" by Arabic peoples. Allah recited to Muhammad the Quran. And a 3rd religion emerged, Islam.</dd>

<ul>
<li>a religion, or</li>
<li>a race, or</li>
<li>a culture, or</li>
<li>a nation</li>

</ul>

<p>
<b>All of these descriptions have some validity.</b>
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
The Jewish people are perhaps best described as an <b><b>extended family</b></b>
</p>

<p>
What is Judaism? What does it mean to be a Jew? Most people, both Jewish
and gentile, would instinctively say that Judaism is a religion. And
yet, there are militant atheists who insist that they are Jews! Is
Judaism a race? If you were to say so, most Jews would think you were an
antisemite! So what is Judaism?
</p>

</aside>

<section id="slide-orgef863b4">
<h3 id="orgef863b4">1. Is Judaism a Religion?</h3>
<ul>
<li>In some senses anyway it is clearly a religion</li>
<li>However many Jews do <b>not</b> believe in religion at all</li>
<li>many don't believe in <b>G-d</b></li>

</ul>


<aside class="notes">
<p>

</p>

<p>
Note:
    Clearly, there is a religion called Judaism, a set of ideas about
    the world and the way we should live our lives that is called "Judaism."
    It is studied in Religious Studies courses and taught to Jewish children
    in Hebrew schools. See What do Jews Believe? for details. There is a lot
    of flexibility about certain aspects of those beliefs, and a lot of
    disagreement about specifics, but that flexibility is built into the
    organized system of belief that is Judaism.
</p>

<p>
However, many people who call themselves Jews do not believe in that
religion at all! More than half of all Jews in Israel today call
themselves "secular," and don't believe in G-d or any of the religious
beliefs of Judaism. Half of all Jews in the United States don't belong
to any synagogue. They may practice some of the rituals of Judaism and
celebrate some of the holidays, but they don't think of these actions as
religious activities.
</p>

<p>
The most traditional Jews and the most liberal Jews and everyone in
between would agree that these secular people are still Jews, regardless
of their disbelief. See Who is a Jew? Clearly, then, there is more to
being Jewish than just a religion.

<h3 id="org0c6fc44">2. Are Jews a Race?</h3>
<ul>
<li>US Supreme Court in 1980's &#x2013; "Yes"</li>
<li>reasoning: "Jewish Race" &#x2013; "Negro Race"</li>

</ul>


<aside class="notes">
<p>

</p>

<p>
Note:
</p>
<ul>
<li>In the 1980s, the United States Supreme Court ruled that Jews are a</li>

</ul>
<p>
race, at least for purposes of certain anti-discrimination laws.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Their reasoning: at the time these laws were passed, people routinely</li>

</ul>
<p>
spoke of the "Jewish race" or the "Italian race" as well as the "Negro
race," so that is what the legislators intended to protect.
</p>

<p>
But many Jews were deeply offended by that decision, offended by any
hint that Jews could be considered a race. The idea of Jews as a race
brings to mind nightmarish visions of Nazi Germany, where Jews were
declared to be not just a race, but an inferior race that had to be
rounded up into ghettos and exterminated like vermin.
</p>

<p>
But setting aside the emotional issues, Jews are clearly not a race.
</p>

<p>
Race is a genetic distinction, and refers to people with shared ancestry
and shared genetic traits. You can't change your race; it's in your DNA.
I could never become black or Asian no matter how much I might want to.
</p>

<p>
Common ancestry is not required to be a Jew. Many Jews worldwide share
common ancestry, as shown by genetic research; however, you can be a Jew
without sharing this common ancestry, for example, by converting. Thus,
although I could never become black or Asian, blacks and Asians have
become Jews (Sammy Davis Jr. and Connie Chung).

<h3 id="org46e735c">3. Is It a Culture or Ethnic Group?</h3>
<ul>
<li>secular American Jews think of their <b>Jewishness</b> as a matter of culture or ethnicity</li>
<li>e.g. food, Yiddish, holidays, values like emphasis on education</li>

</ul>


<aside class="notes">
<p>

</p>

<p>
Note:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Most secular American Jews think of their Jewishness as a matter</li>

</ul>

<p>
of culture or ethnicity. - When they think of Jewish culture, they think
of - the food, - of the Yiddish language, - of some limited holiday
observances, and - of cultural values like the emphasis on education.
</p>

<p>
Those secular American Jews would probably be surprised to learn that
much of what they think of as Jewish culture is really just Ashkenazic
Jewish culture, the culture of Jews whose ancestors come from one part
of the world. Jews have lived in many parts of the world and have
developed many different traditions. As a Sephardic friend likes to
remind me, Yiddish is not part of his culture, nor are bagels and lox,
chopped liver, latkes, gefilte fish or matzah ball soup. His idea of
Jewish cooking includes bourekas, phyllo dough pastries filled with
cheese or spinach. His ancestors probably wouldn't know what to do with
a dreidel. There are certainly cultural traits and behaviors that are
shared by many Jews, that make us feel more comfortable with other Jews.
Jews in many parts of the world share many of those cultural aspects.
However, that culture is not shared by all Jews all over the world, and
people who do not share that culture are no less Jews because of it.
Thus, Judaism must be something more than a culture or an ethnic group.

<h3 id="org143be69">4. Are the Jews a Nation?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The traditional explanation, and the one given in the Torah, is that the Jews are a nation.</li>
<li>The Hebrew word for "nation" is "goy."</li>
<li>ancient sense meaning a <b>group of people with a common history, a common destiny, and a sense that we are all connected to each other</b>.</li>

</ul>


<aside class="notes">
<p>

</p>

<p>
Note:
    Unfortunately, in modern times, the term "nation" has become too
    contaminated by ugly, jingoistic notions of a country obsessed with its
    own superiority and bent on world domination. Because of this notion of
    "nationhood," Jews are often falsely accused of being disloyal to their
    own country in favor of
    their loyalty to the Jewish "nation," of being
    more loyal to Israel than to their home country. Some have gone so far
    as to use this distorted interpretation of "nationhood" to prove that
    Jews do, or seek to, control the world. In fact, a surprising number of
    antisemitic websites and newsgroup postings linked to this page (in an
    earlier form) as proof of their antisemitic delusions that Jews are
    nationalistic, that Israel is a colonial power and so forth. Because of
    the inaccurate connotations that have attached themselves to the term
    "nation," the term can no longer be used to accurately describe the
    Jewish people.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The Torah and the rabbis used this term not in the modern sense
meaning a territorial and political entity, but in the ancient sense
meaning a <b><b>group of people with a common history, a common destiny,
and a sense that we are all connected to each other</b></b>.</li>

<h3 id="org2e5f275">Traditional beliefs</h3>
<p>
a short list of the traditional beliefs of Judaism would include the
following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>God is creator <b>all</b>.</li>
<li>He is <b>one</b></li>
<li>He alone is to be worshipped</li>
<li>first 5 books of Hebrew Bible were revealed to Moses by God</li>
<li>God rewards and punishes for good and evil deeds</li>

<aside class="notes">
<p>

</p>

<p>
Note:
</p>
<ul>
<li>God is the creator of all that exists; He is one, incorporeal</li>

</ul>

<p>
(without a body), and He alone is to be worshipped as absolute ruler of
the universe. - The first five books of the Hebrew Bible were revealed
to Moses by God. They will not be changed or augmented in the future. -
God has communicated to the Jewish people through prophets. - God
monitors the activities of humans; He rewards individuals for good deeds
and punishes evil.

<aside class="notes">

</p>

<p>
Note:
    Although Christians base much of their faith on the same Hebrew
    Scriptures as Jews do, there are major differences in belief:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Jews generally consider <b><b>actions and behavior to be of primary
importance</b></b>; beliefs come out of actions. This conflicts with
conservative Christians for whom belief is of primary importance and
actions are a result of that belief.</li>
<li>Jewish belief does not accept the Christian concept of <b><b>original sin</b></b>
(the belief that all people have inherited Adam and Eve's sin when
they disobeyed God's instructions in the Garden of Eden).</li>
<li>Judaism <b><b>affirms the inherent goodness of the world and its people as
creations of God</b></b>.</li>
