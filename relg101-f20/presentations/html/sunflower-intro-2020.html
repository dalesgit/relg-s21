Note:
I first became aware of this text from one of my students some years ago. I had used Elie Wiesel's <i>Night</i> as a way of engaging the class in the issues involved in "Evil" and the study of religion. That text had the advantage of being well-known to students and an acknowledged classic.
</p>

<p>
After my first use of <i>Sunflower</i> I decided that Wiesenthal's text had some distinct advantages itself. Chief among them was that we could begin the study of <b>evil</b> through the concept of <b>forgiveness</b>. Forgiveness is an experience that is broadly known and experienced from an early age. We experience the difficulty of forgiveness. Our need for forgiveness. The power of forgiveness.
</p>

<p>
At the same time one must have some awareness of the 20th c. "Holocaust", Judaism and the history of anti-Semitism and the complicity of Christianity in that history of anti-Semitism.

<h3 id="orge59e942">Summary of <i>Sunflower</i></h3>
<ul>
<li>While imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp, Simon Wiesenthal was taken one day from his work detail to the bedside of a dying member of the SS.</li>
<li>Haunted by the crimes in which he had participated, the soldier wanted to confess to–and obtain absolution from–a Jew.</li>
<li>Faced with the choice between compassion and justice, silence and truth, Wiesenthal said nothing.</li>
<li>But even years after the way had ended, he wondered: Had he done the right thing? What would you have done in his place?</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Note:
There is something almost lyrical about Wiesenthal's memoir. Is it dream-like? Is it a reverie? In any case it ends with a question.

As noted in an earlier discussion, an alternate name <b>Shoah</b> has been proposed as a more appropriate word than the word <b>Holocaust</b>. "Holocaust" is a word used in the Hebrew Bible to refer to burnt offerings made to God. It is a sacred act. In some contexts it is an act that is favorable to God.

It is thought that as many as eleven million people were killed by the Nazis.

<i>Christianity vs. Judaism has a long history</i>: timeline:

</p>

<p>
These included political opponents (particularly Communists), Slavs, gypsies, mentally and/or physically disabled, homosexuals, and other "undesirables." An estimated six million men, women, and children were killed merely because they were Jews. The destruction of the Jews in Europe stands as the archetype of genocide in human history.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Note:
The <b>theodicy</b> problem does not simply have to do with victims and perpetrators. Possibly the greatest challenge comes to us in trying to understand the role of those who looked on but did not nothing. 
</p>

<p>
In the immediacy of evil those who resist are drawn into the violence and victimizing of the perpetrators. It seems that no one is entirely innocent. The liberators may be present to be liberators because they were silently complicit in the evil.
</p>

<p>
And for all of us, the most important issue has to do with those who come after &#x2013; the children of the <b>Shoah</b>. Will we remember?

Note:
</p>

<p>
The transformation of Germany from a leader of the Enlightenment, one of the most educated and cultured populations in the world, into the nation that perpetrated one of the great horrors of the 20th c. was a gradual one. It includes the history of the rise of a national political party &#x2013; the National Socialists under Adolph Hitler &#x2013; the seduction of a population that gave silent as well as material support to the brutal actions that followed, the imprisonment of a cultural segment of the population, and finally the support of a military operation that gave rise to many of the weapons of mass destruction that are familiar to us to this day.

<p>
Note: 
Jews had been the subjects of persecution in Europe at least since the seventeenth century. When Adolph Hitler rose to power in Germany during the 1920s and early 1930s, he rallied the German people with a message that included notions of "Aryan," or white, superiority and the inferiority of other races. 
</p>

<p>
The Jews were a special target of his hatred, and they were incorrectly represented during this time of social, political, and economic upheaval as being wealthy and in control of the country's economy.

Note:
The table here reveals the long history of efforts to annihilate the Jews (or as the oldest dates would have it, the "Israelites.") The first annihilation came with the destruction of the political state with its capital in Jerusalem. The next came with the destruction of Judea &amp; Jerusalem at the time of Jesus and the writing of the New Testament. In time Christianity replaced the  political power of the Roman Empire and it continued anti-semitic actions. Variation of Christian anti-semitism continued &#x2013; and continue &#x2013; up to the present day.

<p>
"Antisemitism and all other forms of racism present a danger not only to Jews but also to the community of nations. These days the 'new antisemitism' is directed simultaneously against Jews, against Israel and against Zionism. By equating these terms the danger for Jews as a whole is exacerbated. This phenomenon is also common in propaganda emanating from the Arab world. The Holocaust showed the world the extent of the destructive power of antisemitism and racism. Holocaust denial, as well as minimization and banalization of the Holocaust provide a means of avoiding the evident conclusions and learning the lessons for the future. We, the survivors, call upon the world to wipe out these phenomena and to combat them relentlessly." &#x2013; statement by survivors of <b>Shoah</b>
