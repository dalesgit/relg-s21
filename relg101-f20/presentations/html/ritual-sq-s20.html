<ul>
<li>For Jews participating in the Passover meal, there is a combination of memory, worship, and hope.</li>
<li>To celebrate the Passover is to become ritually one with those who first observed it before leaving Egypt.</li>
<li>Thus, Jews celebrate an ancient story in their tradition by reenacting the story in a highly ritualized fashion</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>

</p>

<p>
Note: - At Passover, Jews all over the world gather in their homes to share a formal meal involving the eating of symbolic foods, various readings and prayers, and a number of blessings. - The meal is orchestrated by the head of the household, who conducts it according to well established traditions.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Passover commemorates the meal eaten by the Jews the evening before they left Egypt and the enslavement of their people in order to journey toward, and eventually reach, the Promised Land.</li>
<li>Central to the Passover meal are the great events described in the Bible in the book of Exodus.</li>
<li>One of the high points of the meal comes when the youngest person present at the table asks why the meal is eaten. The response comes in the form of a reading from the haggadah.</li>

<li><b>Holy Communion</b> in Christianity functions in ways that are analogous to the <b>Passover</b> in Judaism.</li>
<li>The various Christian communities give diverse interpretations of the significance of communion.</li>
<li>However, all Christian groups agree that when they celebrate the communion meal, they are reenacting events connected with Jesus of Nazareth.</li>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Note: - The gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, as well as the letter of Paul known as First Corinthians, describe a ceremony involving the use of bread and wine, which are given significance through words attributed to Jesus. - Holy Communion is a ritual reenactment of this story. - Like the Passover meal, the celebration of Holy Communion carries a meaning that the community of believers, long after the event itself, wishes to restate.

Van  Gennep  viewed  rites  of  passage  as  an  essential  ingredient  in  the  rejuvenation  of  society because they highlight and validate changes in a person’s status. Hence, he argues that they serve to preserve social stability by easing the transition of cohorts of individuals into new statuses;  in  part,  this  transition  is  a  social  acknowledgement  of  aging.  Furthermore,  as  individuals  are  born  and  age,  their  positions  in  society  change.  In  the  absence  of  rites  of  passage, he says, society would be fraught with conflict as individuals either struggle to assert new social statuses or resist these statuses. Figure 1 Diagrammatic Summary from Les Rites de Passage (diagram by author) Literal: The Territorial Passage:  A  frontier,  an  imaginary  line  connecting  milestones  marked  by  an  element  of  nature  or  landmark,  has  a  physically  and  magico-religious  quality  (Gennep,  1960;  p.  18).A  person  passing through a frontier finds him or herself in a special situation for a certain length of time; they wavering between two worlds. It is this situation which is designated as a liminal transition.  This symbolic and spatial area of transition may be found in a more or less pronounced form in

<h2 id="orga96e0ca">Religious Meanings of Ritual</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ritual is so closely identified with formal worship that one can generally say that the ends of ritual are the ends of worship.</li>
<li>Traditionally speaking, worship promotes one of these four ends or purposes, or a combination of them:

<ul>
<li>Adoration</li>
<li>Thanksgiving</li>
<li>Petition</li>
<li>Penance/purification</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>

</p>

<ol>
<li>Adoration

<ul>
<li>Basically, adoration means acknowledgment of the sovereignty of the Sacred over the person.</li>
<li>Adoration means the acknowledgment that one is not self-sufficient, but dependent.</li>
<li>In religions with a personal, transcendent God, there are basic ritual gestures assumed in moments of prayer that dramatically illustrate the concept of adoration.</li>
<li>In religions without a transcendent deity, the focus is on the search for enlightenment and the primary gesture of adoration is meditative.</li>

</ul></li>

<li>Thanksgiving

<ul>
<li>Because one of the basic insights of many religious traditions is that the world and all its bounty flow from the world of the sacred, it is only fitting that such traditions emphasize the need to acknowledge that gift.</li>
<li>The most common form of thanksgiving is the ritual act of giving a gift. Such donations may run from the formal act of a sacrifice, to the leaving of a gift at an altar or shrine</li>

</ul></li>

<li>Petition</li>

<li>Penance / Purification</li>

<p>
Ancient Spartan Helot Killing male rite of passage
</p>

<p>
For ancient Spartans, becoming a soldier was the only way one could be recognized as a man. Military training began at age seven when boys would be taken from their families and placed in the Agoge system. For the next 10 years Spartan boys learned the skills necessary to become a trained killing machine.

<b>Maasai Warrior Passage</b>

<p>
Maasai Warrior boys male rite of passage (5:50 min)
</p>

<p>
The Maasai of Kenya and Tanzania have a series of rites of passage that carry boys into manhood. Every 10 or 15 years a new warrior class will be initiated into the tribe. Boys between the ages of 10 and 20 are brought together from all across the country. Dozens of houses are built that will serve as the place of initiation. The night before the ceremony, the boys sleep outside in the forest. At dawn, they return to the little makeshift homestead for a day of singing and dancing. They drink a mixture of milk, cow's blood, and alcohol and eat piles and piles of meat. After the festivities, boys who are of age (12-16) are ready to be circumcised.

<b>Mandan Hook Hanging</b>

<p>
Mandan indians Hook Hanging male rite of passage
</p>

<p>
Native American tribes each had their own unique coming of age rituals for the men in the tribe. But few were as intense as that of the Mandans. Before his rite-of-passage, a Mandan boy fasted for 3 days to cleanse his body of impurities. Then, on the day of the ritual, elders of tribe would pierce the boy's chest, shoulder, and back muscles with large wooden splints. Ropes, which extended from the roof of a hut, were then attached to the splints, and the young man was winched up into the air, his whole body weight suspended from the ropes. Despite the pain, the boy was not to cry out in pain. While hanging in the air, more splints were hammered through his arms and legs. Skulls of his dead grandfather and other ancestors were placed on the ends of the splints.

Sambia Papa New Guinea male rite of passage
</p>

<p>
In the small country of Papau New Guinea, over 1,000 different culture groups exist. Among them is the Sambia tribe, a group with perhaps the most insane rite of passage into manhood in the world.
</p>

<p>
The initiation begins at age seven with the separation of the boy from the mother. The boy will spend the rest of his young life only in the presence of men in an all male hut. The gender separation is taken to such extremes that boys and women use different walking paths around the village. &#x2026;
