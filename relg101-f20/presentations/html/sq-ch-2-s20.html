<li>Many have the experience or can imagine the difference between sacred and not-sacred. I think of my experience one Christmas midnight. We walked out of Grace Cathedral in  San Francisco after midnight mass. We got in our car and drove 2 blocks and there was a bustling street advertising "Live Sex" shows. The contrast was stark.</li>
<li>Biblical Hebrew for “Sacred” indicates a reality that is somehow distinct, “set apart,” “other” than ordinary.</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>“Sacred” is a complex word because it is used for a wide range of phenomena: places, time, persons, events, and deities.</li>
<li>But, generally, when people speak of something as sacred, they mean to designate the thing in question as “other than ordinary.”</li>
<li>In the broadest sense of the term, the sacred is the “extraordinary.”</li>
<li>The value of using the term “sacred” is that it is not tradition specific.</li>

<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Often the words “sacred” and “holy” are used as equivalents.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Thus, the best way to identify the sacred is to identify that which is designated holy.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">The early Israelites were instructed: “Observe the sabbath day and keep it holy.”</li>
<li class="fragment appear">A popular Christian hymn begins “Holy, holy, holy, Lord God almighty!”</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Islamic tradition refers to Jerusalem as <i>al-quds—the holy city, or the city set apart</i>.</li>

O God, you are my God, I seek you, my soul thirsts for you; my flesh faints for you, as in a dry and weary land where there is no water. So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary, beholding your power and glory. Because your steadfast love is better than life,my lips will praise You. (Psalm 63:1–3)

<h3 id="org9175d27">The Concept of Sacred Reality</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Derived from the Latin “sanctus”.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">“Sanctus” means “holy” and refers to something separated or set apart from other things.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">The related terms from the Hebrew (<i>kadosh  קדוש ) and the Greek (/hagios, 'αγιος</i>) mean the same.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">At minimum, the sacred is distinct from the profane.</li>

<h3 id="org6d68faf">Sacred Reality in Various Cultures</h3>
<ul>
<li>Biblical witness is that <b>God</b> is only truly <b>holy</b> &#x2013; all else is holy because it is connected to God</li>

<li><p>
Ancient Rome <b>sanctus</b> applied to the temples where rituals were dedicated to gods. <i>Fanum</i> was the name of the temple. Ritual was performed "before" the <i>fanum</i> &#x2013; and were thus <b>pro</b> (before) the <b>fanum</b>.
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>In the Bible, *God is preeminently sacred or holy, and everyone else and everything else is holy or sacred only in relation to God.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>In ancient Rome, sanctus applied as much to the place of certain activities as to the activities themselves. 
<ul>
<li>Those acts that were sanctified were performed in the <i>fanum or temple; other acts were pro fanum</i>, that is, performed in front of or outside the temple.</li>

<h3 id="org22b7b9d">Sacred Reality in the Hebrew Bible</h3>
<ul>
<li>in Hebrew Bible <i>kadosh</i> is used of those things God has chosen:
<ul>
<li>the people of Israel</li>
<li>the land of the people</li>
<li>certain foods (<b>kosher</b>)</li>
<li>certain human relations</li>

</ul></li>

nothing is special except in relation to God
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
   
</p>
<ul>
<li>By contrast, the Hebrew Bible uses <i>kadosh</i> to describe God and things set apart by God’s choice: the people of Israel, the land they live in, types of food, modes of human relations.</li>
<li>There is nothing special about such things except that they are chosen by God or are in some kind of relation to God.</li>

<ul>
<li>The sacred can further be characterized in terms of “the real.”</li>
<li>The sacred stands for that which provides absolute and objective authority to an otherwise relative and subjective existence.</li>
<li>The sacred consists of an entirely different order than the ordinary life of human beings, but is manifest through ordinary existence.</li>
<li>Stones, trees, the sky, bodies of water, various people—all these may be the vehicles of the sacred and thus share in its distinctive reality.</li>
