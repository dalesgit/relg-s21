<h3 id="the-foundation-for-morality">The Foundation for Morality</h3>
<ul>
<li>Many people claim that religion is the <b>foundation for all morality</b>.</li>
<li>In this way, it is religion that teaches people what is good or right or praiseworthy.</li>
<li>For some religious traditions, the phrase "obey the commands of God" expresses the highest standard of the moral life.</li>
<li>But this claim raises the key questions (first posed by Socrates): "<b>Do the gods love the good because it is good, or is it good because the gods love it?</b>"</li>

As some scholars put it, religious considerations lead one to think in "sacred-regarding" terms, moral considerations in "other-regarding" terms.

<li>Religion and morality are interconnected, but <b>religion and morality can also conflict</b>.</li>
<li>If such conflicts occur, which is to have priority?</li>

<p>
A classic example was set in mid-20th c. US where Martin Luther King Jr. knew full well that the "civil disobedience" he led was contrary to the prevailing ethics (and laws) of the time. He understood, however, that a higher principle was at stake. The higher principle derived from the prophetic tradition of the Bible.

Note:
</p>

<p>
<b>Consider the moral problems raised by the biblical story of Abraham. Common to all 3 Religions of Abraham</b>
</p>

<p>
Note: In the story, God commands Abraham to sacrifice his son, Isaac, as a way of testing Abraham's faith.

<h3 id="soren-kiekegaard">Soren Kiekegaard</h3>
<ul>
<li>Kierkegaard analyzed the story of Abraham as a <b>paradox between Abraham's two "loves" &#x2013; his son and God</b>.</li>
<li>Abraham was (evidently) willing to sacrifice his son at God's command, which indicates that his love of God took priority.</li>
<li>Thus, Abraham was a true "<b>knight of faith</b>."</li>
<li>Abraham's love for God is an example of the <b>religious point of view taking priority over the moral</b>.</li>

</ul>



</section>
<section id="slide-immanuel-kant" data-audio-src='../audio/sq-morality-audio/3.4.ogg'>
<h3 id="immanuel-kant">Immanuel Kant</h3>
<ul>
<li>Kant takes the opposite position of Kierkegaard.</li>
<li>Kant argued that if anyone thinks he or she hears a command like that of Abraham's, it is <b>obligatory to ignore or renounce that directive</b>.</li>
<li>Thus, the positions of Kant and Kierkegaard present two sides of the questions about which should take priority, religion or morality, in cases of conflict.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.csus.edu/indiv/g/gaskilld/ethics/kantian%20ethics.htm">Overview of Categorical Imperative</a> 1st formulation of which is: "<b>Act only in such a way that one can at the same time will that it should become a universal law</b>."</li>

</p>

<p>
This could be an exercise:
Consider the discussion question from SQ (130)
</p>

<p>
The Muslim theologian al-Ash'ari (d. 935 CE) argued that the only sure basis for moral knowledge was the command of God made known in revealed texts such as the Qur'an. He argued that God was the Supreme Lord of the worlds, whose commands were always to be obeyed; and he went on to say that if God commanded human beings to lie, then lying would be obligatory. Does this seem right to you? Why or why not? What view of the religion&#x2013;morality relation is suggested by al-Ash'ari's comment?

<h2 id="org28b395c">Ethics</h2>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Note:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The discussion of the relations between religion and morality is a part of the general study of ethics or the inquiry into the nature of the good life.</li>
<li>The study of ethics focuses on such questions and involves an attempt to develop theories of the nature and foundation of human judgment.</li>

<h3 id="orgdd71624">Justification</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>justification</b> &#x2013; or reasons for action</li>
<li><b>practical justification</b> = advancing reasons in support of a particular action</li>
<li><b>religious reasons</b> may or may not be advanced</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Note:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Underlying all of these issues is the problem of practical justification, or the question of reasons for action.</li>
<li>Practical justification involves the process of <b>advancing reasons in support of a particular action</b>.</li>
<li>Religious reasons may or may not be advanced as a part of the practical justification.</li>
<li>Consider, for example, the practical justifications that might be advanced on each side of the abortion debate.</li>

</ul>


<p>
Justification - In any given case of action or judgment about the rightness of action, then, it is possible to ask for reasons. - The attempt to provide reasons for actions and judgments involves persons and groups in the process of practical justification. - The example of the arguments surrounding abortion presents one illustration of such a process.

<ul>
<li>consider the 10 commandments:</li>
<li>The issue is one of formal adherence to a given standard of action, <b>regardless of the good or bad consequences</b> that follow.</li>
<li><p>
Examples:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Abortion is wrong because it violates the rule "Thou shalt not kill."</li>
<li>Abortion is wrong because it violates the command of God.</li>

</p></li>

<li>a person has an inherent right to control over his/her own body</li>
<li>another person does not have a right to make decisions for another over control of his/her own body</li>
<li>even as one grants full status as a "human person" to the unborn fetus, the mother also has a full status as a "human person", i.e. "<b>no one human being may be reduced to the status of a mere instrument in order to serve the needs of another human being</b>"</li>
