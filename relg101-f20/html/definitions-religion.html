He also became influential in the evolution of Higher Criticism, and his work forms part of the foundation of the modern field of hermeneutics. Because of his profound effect on subsequent Christian thought, he is often called the "Father of Modern Liberal Theology" and is considered an early leader in liberal Christianity. The Neo-Orthodoxy movement of the twentieth century, typically (though not without challenge) seen to be spearheaded by Karl Barth, was in many ways an attempt to challenge his influence.

<p>
The nineteenth-century German thinker Karl Marx, the founder and primary theorist of Marxism, had an antithetical and complex attitude to religion,[1] viewing it primarily as "the soul of soulless conditions", the "opium of the people" that had been useful to the ruling classes since it gave the working classes false hope for millennia. At the same time Marx saw religion as a form of protest by the working classes against their poor economic conditions and their alienation.[2]

</p>

<p>
Sigmund Freud's views on religion are described in several of his books and essays. Freud regarded God as an illusion, based on the infantile need for a powerful father figure; religion, necessary to help us restrain violent impulses earlier in the development of civilization, can now be set aside in favor of reason and science.[1]

<li><b>cautious, recognizing that we cannot escape our own perspective</b> &#x2026;</li>

<li>it may also be a result of influence of <b>Judeo-Christian</b> tradition</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
The very attempt to define religion, to find some distinctive or possibly unique essence or set of qualities that distinguish the "religious" from the remainder of human life, is primarily a Western concern. The attempt is a natural consequence of the Western speculative, intellectualistic, and scientific disposition. It is also the product of the dominant Western religious mode, what is called the Judeo-Christian climate or, more accurately, the theistic inheritance from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. 
</p>

<p>
The theistic form of belief in this tradition, even when downgraded culturally, is formative of the dichotomous Western view of religion. That is, the basic structure of theism is essentially a distinction between a transcendent deity and all else, between the creator and his creation, between God and man.

<p>
Religion is intimately connected with human thought.
</p>

<p>
Even those who focus on practice have beliefs, develop doctrines, and emphasize the importance of certain teachings in the religious life essential to their way of life.
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
We have theologians. The history of Christian thought. Middle ages philosophy &amp; theology were the king / queen of all the sciences.
</p>

<p>
There is a long tradition of theologians. We have centuries of tradition of philosophy and systematically thinking about religion and the Bible. We are perhaps familiar with thinking about religion in the form of right thinking.

<h3 id="org42af094">Religion and Feeling</h3>
<p>
To some extent, all religious experience is an emotional experience.
</p>

<p>
Friedrich Schleiermacher characterized religion as a <b>feeling of absolute dependence</b>. 
</p>

<p>
Rudolf Otto, characterized religion as the <b>experience of the holy</b>. And this experience is one that inspires feelings of <b>fear, awe, terror, and love</b>. 
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Consider the ways in which we use <b>feel</b> and <b>think</b> interchangeably. "I feel that &#x2026;"
</p>

<p>
Feeling has become an important part of the way we experience religion for centuries now. It may even seem the most natural to you.

<li>Islam = the duty of prayer and <b>salat</b></li>
<li>Shinto = approach the shrine of kami by washing, ringing a bell, and clapping their hands</li>
<li>Roman Catholicism =  attend mass</li>

<p>
In religion there is an essential tension between the <b>individual</b> and <b>the community</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the most elementary components of religion is some emphasis on the idea of society.</li>
<li>Thus, the essence of religion is the ways in which it enables individual persons to identify with the values associated with a particular group.</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Most of the great religions make a place for <b>individual devotion</b> and encourage persons to search for <b>union with the ultimate reality</b>.</li>
<li>But we must be careful not to overstress the individual dimension of religion.</li>
<li>Some religious traditions emphasize the social dimension of religion far more than we might recognize.</li>

<li>Religion is a way of expressing important societal values.</li>

**  A Notion of Sacred Reality
</p>

<ul>
<li>A <b>notion of sacred reality establishes a boundary between religion and non-religion.</b></li>
<li><b>Sacred</b> indicates a reality that is somehow distinct, set apart, other than <b>ordinary</b>.</li>
<li>Sacred reality includes the God of the <b>Bible</b>, the <b>Qur'anic Allah</b>, the <b>Brahman</b> of Hinduism, Buddhism's <b>Nirvana</b>, the <b>kami</b> of Shinto.</li>

</ul>


<p>
**  Manifest in Human Experience
</p>

<ul>
<li>Although the sacred is <b>set apart from the ordinary</b>, it nevertheless may be experienced, thought about, and acted upon.</li>
<li>Thus, all religion has to do with the element of the <b>sacred manifesting itself in various ways</b>: in rituals, persons, and natural phenomena.

<ol>
<li>Muslims = the sacred reality (<b><b>Allah</b></b>) is made manifest through prophecy</li>
<li>Buddhists = the goal of <b>Nirvana</b> comes to life in the life and teaching of the Buddha</li>
<li>Navaho = the story of the Navaho people makes wisdom available for those who seek harmony between all things.</li>

</ol></li>

</ul>


<p>
**  Long-Lasting Ways of Thinking and Feeling
</p>

<ul>
<li>Religious ways <b>develop over time</b>.  And they come to constitute <b>traditions</b> that may be identified with the history of particular communities.
<ul>
<li>For example, the prophecy of Muhammad is the beginning of the tradition of Islam.</li>
<li>Islam's message and the story of its revelation in seventh-century Arabia have produced characteristic modes of thought, feeling, and action among a large percentage of the world's population.</li>

</ul></li>

<p>
**  Ordering and Understanding Existence
</p>

<ul>
<li>Stresses the way in which notions of sacred reality are related to problems of suffering and death.</li>
<li>Also stresses the way in which notions of sacred reality are related to other problems; such as the ordering of political or economic life.</li>
