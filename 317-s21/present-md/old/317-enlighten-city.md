from enlightenment to a new world
=================================

locke and deists
----------------

-   nearly all the attitudes of the time came together in john locke
-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kitxvjlnttk>
-   many deists brought to bear on the biblical miracle stories all the
    prestige of the scientific discovery of laws
-   deists distrusted appeals to authority and the miraculous, but they
    also turned away from anything beyond natural religion in part for
    moral reasons.

pietists and methodists
-----------------------

-   \"**enthusiasm**\" was a dirty word in the eighteenth century.
-   story begins in germany, where lutheran orthodoxy had increasingly
    defined faith as assent to a set of doctrines
-   lutherans suspect any call to moral improvement as a move toward
    works-righteousness.
-   methodism with a \"method\" for holiness
-   wesley and whitefield changed the shape of popular religion in
    england and north america, but they made little impact on the
    attitudes among most intellectuals

the end of reason
-----------------

-   hume
-   rousseau
-   kant
