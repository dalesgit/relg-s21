::: {.NOTES}
Note: Mass Bay Colony. Established by **Puritans** (219) consciously
seeking to make something new. Sharing a common **dream**. Quote
JWinthrop p. 219). \"Come for religious purity.\"
:::

Covenant
========

Territory & the Church faith within it
--------------------------------------

-   Now to be understood as an individual\'s commitment (covenant) --
    not a function of being born into a territory
-   seen by some as a modification of strict Calvinist predetermination
    -- because keeping the covenant was freely entered into -- then
    becomes an obligation

::: {.NOTES}
Note: Federal theology: (220) God has entered into covenant and \"if we
fulfill our part of the agreement by believing in him, he will reward us
with salvation.\"

John Cotton rejected the federal theology in favor of pure Calvinism.
:::

Ann Hutchinson
--------------

-   prophecies & visions -- her view that **grace** could come to anyone
    -- \"**unpredictable grace seemed to threaten**\" the discipline
    needed to make the \"city on a hill\" work (cf. quote 221)
-   **conversion** came to be a requirement for inclusion in the civic
    community ... communion, baptism, etc.

::: {.NOTES}
Note: All of the **accomodations** required work-arounds etc.

\"Puritanism seemed to be slowly yielding to **rationalism**\" -- then
**Great Awakening**

cp. the impact of **Billy Graham** -- ask about?

quote (222) re. his conversion
:::

Jonathan Edwards
----------------

-   science vs. traditional theology. For JE \"orthodox Calvinism fit
    best with modern science. Accepting Locke\'s view that our knowledge
    begins with **experience**
-   not necessarily **materialism** from scientific perspective
-   JE saw correspondence between Newton\'s view of the universe and
    Calvin\'s predetestination (223) \"...setting traditional doctrines
    in a new metaphysical context. He believed in a God so powerful he
    left no room for anything else.\"
-   George Whitefield (1740) built on the outburst of conversion
    experiences -- JE defended the developments

::: {.NOTES}
Note: cf. the views of contemporary science?

Cf. hearing about **revival meetings** and **camp meetings** at church
on Sunday
:::

Rational religion
-----------------

-   Benjamin Franklin
-   Thomas Jefferson
-   And yet until the 1880\'s (223) \"every state except Rhode Island
    still required some sort of religious affirmation from anyone
    seeking public office (Church & State)
-   **Rationalism** \"took institutional form in **Unitarianism** --
    rejection of Trinity, original sin, predestination

::: {.NOTES}
Note: cf. the \"gibe\* about Unitarians (224)
:::

Revivals on the Frontier
------------------------

-   Nathaniel W. Taylor & Lyman Beecher organizing frontier revivals
-   Charles Finney carried revivals into New York -- priding himself on
    his lack of sophistication
-   Mother Ann Lee experienced visions that led her to form a Quakerism
    for women (**the female aspect of divinity**)
-   Oneida community -- eschatological communities
-   Seventh Day Adventists -- incorporating Jewish elements into their
    communitarianism
-   Joseph Smith: Latter Day Saints

::: {.NOTES}
Cf. the opening of new communitarian experiments in the 1950\'s -
1970\'s
:::

Romanticism in America
----------------------

-   reaction to **rationalism** ... a cluster of responses called
    **romanticism**
-   Ralph W. Emerson ... appealing to **intuition** --
    \"transcendentalism\"
-   leading in a variety of paths
-   Horace Bushnell (before Civil War) \"attacking individualism and the
    emphasis on revivals and raising questions about rationalism in
    religion.\" (229)

::: {.NOTES}
Note: cf. New Age impulses going in many directions

Bushnell rejected both traditional Calvinism and Unitarianism.
Literalism. Bible should be read as \"poetic forms of life.\" Atonement
in more corporate terms. -- **sounding very modern to my ears**
:::

Slavery & Black religion
------------------------

-   cf. opening p. 230 -- we must not ignore \"full consequences of
    slavery and non-emancipation\" in story of American church
-   race pecularly the criteria in American slavery
-   \"In America ... only the Quakers (starting in the 1750s) really
    demanded\" that the church reject slavery (230)
-   the unfulfilled dream of Puritan America
-   \(231) ... are we a city on a hill? Inspiring the world?

::: {.NOTES}
Note: Anglicans only Protestant group not to divide over slavery and
Civil War
