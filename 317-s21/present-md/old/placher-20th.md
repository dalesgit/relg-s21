Hope & Eschatology
==================

-   reaction to Bultmann: viz. place of **Old Testament** for Christian
    theology
-   Schweitzer & others have shown the importance of **eschatology** for
    understanding New Testament
-   Pannenberg: Christian theology must understand itself in the world
    we live in
-   Dorothy Sölle: role of **suffering** in Theology

::: {.NOTES}
Notes:

OT use: p. 263/268. One contra Bultmann, one MLK re. liberation

Issue: use of OT in Christian theology

-   pre-figuring NT
-   superceded
-   needing figurative interpretation

Wolfhart Pannenberg (2 October 1928 -- 4 September 2014) was a German
theologian. He has made a number of significant contributions to modern
theology, including his concept of **history as a form of revelation
centered on the Resurrection of Christ**, which has been widely debated
in both Protestant and Catholic theology, as well as by non-Christian
thinkers.

She wrote a large number of books, including *Theology for Skeptics:
Reflections on God*, *The Silent Cry: Mysticism and Resistance* (2001)
and her autobiography *Against the Wind: Memoir of a Radical Christian*
(1999). In *Beyond Mere Obedience: Reflections on a Christian Ethic for
the Future* she coined the term \"Christofascist\" to describe
fundamentalists. Perhaps her best-known work in English was *Suffering*,
which offers a critique of \"Christian masochism\" and \"theological
sadism\". Sölle\'s **critique is against the assumption that God is
all-powerful and the cause of suffering**; humans thus suffer for some
greater purpose. Instead, God suffers and is powerless alongside us.
Humans are to struggle together against oppression, sexism,
anti-Semitism, and other forms of authoritarianism.

::: {.NOTES}
Notes: Karl Theodor Jaspers (German: \[ˈjaspɐs\]; 23 February 1883 -- 26
February 1969) was a German-Swiss psychiatrist and philosopher who had a
strong influence on modern theology, psychiatry, and philosophy. After
being trained in and practicing psychiatry, Jaspers turned to
philosophical inquiry and attempted to discover an innovative
philosophical system. He was often viewed as a major exponent of
existentialism in Germany, though he did not accept the label.

cannot speak, thereof one must be silent." ― Ludwig Wittgenstein,

"Death is not an event in life: we do not live to experience death. If
we take eternity to mean not infinite temporal duration but
timelessness, then eternal life belongs to those who live in the
present. Our life has no end in the way in which our visual field has no
limits." ― Ludwig Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus

We feel that even if all possible scientific questions be answered, the
problems of life have still not been touched at all." ― Ludwig

expressed.
