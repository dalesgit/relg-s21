# Counter-Reformation

## 5 themes


### Humanity and Divinity of Christ:

1.  how fit the Catholic humanists in this?

### Reason and revelation: (What is true? Path to salvation?)

1.  cf. bible and tradition vs. bible alone

### Works and Grace:

1.  maintaining a tension,
2.  cp. Contarini with similar exp. to Luther

### Spirit and Structure: canons and \"reforms\" aimed at structure,

1.  cf. also the turmoil over Carmelites

### Church and State:

1.  nb that German Lutherans overthrew state authority, tradition that
    state followed ruler,
2.  Rome pretensions to the Roman Empire (left over from high middle
    ages synthesis)

-   reading Calvin elicits not an emotional response but a cumulative one from the systematic presentation p 188
-   response to (free) grace is a **reformed** life (thus the name)
-   in contrast to Luther\'s distinction between law and gospel, Calvin thought we stood in the same convenant as Abraham (189)
-   \"Reflections on how we come to be saved led to the doctrine of predestination (189 ff.)
