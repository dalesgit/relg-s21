Earthquakes and God\'s will
---------------------------

Voltaire

-   a tale of 2 earthquakes
-   he found the evidence for his belief in nature rather than in the
    Bible; he doubted a good bit of traditional doctrine---and he didn't
    treat religion all that seriously.
-   Revivals but at heart a move from God to human beings

::: {.NOTES}
Do we explain these by reference to God? No? We are inheritors of
Enlightenment.

p\. 203 it is the **shifting of place** re. God and world -- what is
important
:::

From God-centered to Human-centered
-----------------------------------

-   5 catalysts for change (204)

1.  wars of religion
2.  Europe divided
3.  philosophical attitudes encouraged questioning tradition
4.  science seemed to being moving from one accomplishment to another
    ...
5.  nationalism taking root, centralizing power

-   at the very time of success in discovery and technology, reason
    seemed to reach its end of life

Descartes to Newton
===================

Newton on religion
------------------

-   Newton: God's \"immensity\" stretching infinitely in all directions
    and unchanged for all eternity (cp. changing metaphor) (cp. Borges)
-   what was most important about religion was its morality -- cf.
    Jefferson\'s approach (206)
-   while retaining religion, it is no stripped of the \"supernatural\"
-   \"natural religion\" (206)
-   Church of England would keep its theology vague enough to include as
    many groups as possible and tolerate the presence of some dissenting
    groups like Anabaptists and Quakers, though not Catholics

::: {.NOTES}
cf. 3 parts of Anglican: hi, lo, broad
:::

Borges
------

Universal history is the history of a handful of metaphors

-   changing metaphor from Anselm to Descartes

::: {.NOTES}
read from *Labyrinths* \"The fearful sphere of Pascal\"
:::

### Locke and Deists

-   Nearly all the attitudes of the time came together in John
    Locke (207)
-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kItXvJLnTtk>
-   Many Deists brought to bear on the biblical miracle stories all the
    prestige of the scientific discovery of laws (209)
-   Deists distrusted appeals to authority and the miraculous, but they
    also turned away from anything beyond natural religion in part for
    moral reasons.

### Religion of Reason

Descartes argued that knowledge would come only from doubting everything

-   can a religion be built on Doubt?
-   No man shall ever be kept out of Heaven ... if he had but an honest
    and good heart, that was ready to comply with Christ's
    commandments (205)
-   God is more inward to us than our very souls (205)

### Pietists and Methodists

-   \"**Enthusiasm**\" was a dirty word in the eighteenth century. (210)
-   story begins in Germany, where Lutheran orthodoxy had increasingly
    defined faith as assent to a set of doctrines
-   Lutherans suspect any call to moral improvement as a move toward
    works-righteousness.
-   rise of **Pietism** (210)
-   Moravians and J. Wesley intersect (211)
-   Methodism with a \"method\" for holiness
-   Wesley and Whitefield changed the shape of popular religion in
    England and North America, but they made little impact on the
    attitudes among most intellectuals

::: {.NOTES}
Read Wesley quote of his conversion p. 211

nb. that for Wesley, too, morality was more important than doctrine
:::

The end of Age of Reason
========================

Hume
----

-   skeptic of scientific inference producing absolute knowledge
-   apply skepticism to argument from order; miracles; and others ...

Rousseau
--------

-   doubting even **civilization** -- cf. *Emile* raised as a **natural
    child**
-   follow self & respect others (214)
-   Lessing: story of 3 rings (214)

::: {.NOTES}
see how we identify with the motto of Rousseau above
:::

Kant
----

-   seeking necessity of religion apart from historical evidence
-   Pietist upbringing
-   his arguments **begin with ethics** -- *universal imperative*
-   like much of enlightenment thinkers: accepting God but nothing to do
    with most **doctrine**
-   summary (217)

::: {.NOTES}
we ought to do the thing that we could make a universal law
