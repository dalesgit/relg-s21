========

Humanity / Divinity of Christ
-----------------------------

-   John 1 (NRSV) 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
    God, and the Word was God. 2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All
    things came into being through him, and without him not one thing
    came into being. What has come into being 4 in him was life, ...
-   Matthew 13:55 Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother
    called Mary? And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and
    Judas?

Spirit and Structure
--------------------

-   Romans 8:2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set
    you free from the law of sin and of death.

Reason and Revelation
---------------------

-   Romans 16:25 Now to God who is able to strengthen you according to
    my gospel and the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the
    revelation of the mystery that was kept secret for long ages

Works and Grace
---------------

-   2 Timothy 1:9 who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not
    according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace.
    This grace was given to us in Christ Jesus before the ages began,

Church and State
----------------

-   Romans 13 Let every person be subject to the governing authorities;
    for there is no authority except from God, and those authorities
    that exist have been instituted by God.

Chapter 17
==========

Trust in History, progress, rational.
-------------------------------------

The 19th c. began with a reaction against the perceived sterile
rationalism of the Enlightenment and a trust that History itself was
moving forward, upward, and in a better direction. Progress was
inevitably being made through a kind of invisible Hegelian god­like
hand. What evidence do you see, for and against the progress of history?

\"Genius\"
----------

The text notes that \"A new spirit of nationalism created new interest
in various national traditions ­­ the brothers Grimm scoured the
countryside for old folktales, composers incorporated folk tunes in
their symphonies.\" The previous chapter was titled \"City on a Hill\"
and seemed to focus on the particular \"genius\" of the American
experiment. Discuss the pros and cons of the \"new spirit of
nationalism\" referenced in the 17th chapter.

Church and society (culture)
----------------------------

*Christianity is radically not like society* **or** *Christianity is
faith expressed through a society*

-   The 19th c. wrestled with these statements, both of which seem to be
    true in some respects.

Where do we see them being reconciled in today\'s world?

Revelation
----------

Between the statement \"The Bible is the very Word of God\" and the
statement \"The Bible is an example of many kinds of literature, myth,
preaching all mixed together but very much a human product\" there is a
great gulf. What would a middle ground look like?
