			* Law & Gospel
			* [https://schoolworkhelper.net/key-changes-of-renaissance-and-reformation/](https://schoolworkhelper.net/key-changes-of-renaissance-and-reformation/)
	*  Questions and issues
		* new worlds, discovery
		* cf. Michener pp on 1500's
		* "reform" implies what?
* Luther
	* 1500's
		* epigram re. we are "becoming"
		* Luther (in all his complexity) and his struggles
	* Luther against the world
		* near contemporary = Columbus discovering new world
		* as **nominalist** he taught that with help of grace we earn our own salvation
		* **Purgatory** as a concept and related **indulgences**
		* 95 theses
		* L. gained support from humanists (Renaissance) &#x2013; cf. Erasmus
		* Erasmus sought to clear away corruption and restore simple ethical Christianity
		* L.'s conservatism on social issues
		* Thomas Munzer (trust in Spirit) conflict with L. &#x2013; he saw the end times and 2nd Coming
	* Zurich and Zwingli
		* Z. shared L.'s desire for reform, but different emphasis
		* Z. started with absolute authority of scripture
		* Z. partly allied with Erasmus in desire to cleanse the church
		* Z. and L. in different political environments (princedom vs. democracy)
		* infant baptism?
		* eucharist *consubstantiation* vs. *symbolize*

		* justification by faith (though we remain sinners) cf. P. Wismer's analogy re. looking at the board of writing but "seeing" a clean board
		* continued debate about the role of grace and our participation with it
		* increasingly "faith" meant an "assent to a set of propositions." p. 167
	* radical reformation
		* an "odd collection of pacificsts and violent revolutionaries, eccentric individualists and tightly knit communities, biblical literalists and those who followed the inner voice of the Spirit"
		* anabaptists ("rebaptizers")

### 4. Ch. 13: Counter Reformation

#### 13 Catholic Reformation

##### questions and focus

* read Erasmus
* "authority" and scripture, tradition
* Read Don Quixote? What have to do with Christian thought? Knighthood? Chivalry? "Good citizen"
* read Pascal: wager, end of logic?
* what is "pietism"

##### epithoughts

* Erasmius yielded to Loyola (desire for reform)
* response of Church "a more militant, less tolerant church"

##### Council of Trent

* p. 173 notion of "justification" which many thought as a kind of property people have or don't, &#x2013; L. "no righteousness of our own but only share in Christ's righteousness"
* Trent set forth doctrinal statements on Scripture and tradition, original sin, justification, and the sacraments that have provided the basis of Catholic theology ever since," laid foundation for reform
	* Scripture and tradition equally
	* L. had said original sin destroyed will, Catholics sought compromise
	* Justification as a "process" not instantaneous as L. thought
	* Sacraments and reform: 7 sacraments, transubstantiation, sacrifice on altar repeated, purgatory and indulgences (but warned re. abuse)

##### Jesuits and mystics

* Don Quixote and Loyola (Knight for Christ)
* S.J. sending missionaries world wide, adapting to customs of people they met
* Carmelites (John and Teresa)

##### Continuing debates

* Jesuits at center of response to Protestantism
* "Aquinas had taught that we talk about God "analogically"
* Port Royal Jansenists &#x2013; rigorous piety and trust in grace as opposed to Jesuits whom they saw as "Pelagian"
* Pascal: genius of age &#x2026; conversion "Fire, God of Abraham &#x2026;" trust in grace while being well trained in reason as mathematician
* Pascal defense of Christianity, but ultimately Pope ruled against Jansenist radical trust in grace (not own will)
* Fenelon, "Quietism", Mme. Guyon == claiming that usual rules don't apply because of special relationship with God
