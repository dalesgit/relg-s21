<p>Harnack was his student. History of Christian doctrine – corruption of Christ's original teaching through Greek influences.</p>
<p>History of religions theologicans like E. Troeltsch concluded Christianity emerged gradually out of a context of Jewish and middle eastern religions.</p>
<p>Johannes Weiss and Albert Schweitzer argued that Jesus context had been <strong>apocalypticism</strong> – expectation that a cataclysm was approaching and a <strong>new age</strong> would be ushered in.</p>
<p>Nietzsche: argued that the influence of Christianity had been <strong>negative</strong>! We are not moving towards <strong>truth</strong> but truth is simply whatever a society agrees to call &quot;true&quot;.</p>
