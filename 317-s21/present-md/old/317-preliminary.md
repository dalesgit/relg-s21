::: {.NOTES}
:::

Modern era
----------

Given an understanding of the modern period beginning with the
Reformation:

- What characteristics are associated with the period?
- What might characterize a \"post-modern\" period?

History
-------

What does the following quote mean:

> All histories, including the history of Christian theology, rest on
> the interplay between remembering and forgetting.\" (xxiv)

Denominational History
----------------------

The limits to our perspective (on things) is sometimes vast:

- most of us learn church theology and church history from a
  denominational perspective
- we enter the study through a particular portal
- understanding will come through self-awareness of our own
  limitations

Limitations and warnings (p. 2)
-------------------------------

Placher sets parameters for his text:

1. It is history of Christian theology, not general history,
   intellectual history, etc.
2. Theology means the systematic reflection on one\'s faith.
   (experience?) An \"elite\" enterprise?
3. Much ends up being ignored
4. Too favorable picture of \"theology\"?
