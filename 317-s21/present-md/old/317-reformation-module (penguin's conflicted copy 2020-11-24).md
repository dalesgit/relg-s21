  God, and the Word was God. 2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All
  things came into being through him, and without him not one thing
  came into being. What has come into being 4 in him was life, ...
- Matthew 13:55 Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother
  called Mary? And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and
  Judas?

### epigram re. we are "becoming"

> This life, therefore, is not righteousness, but growth in righteousness; not health but healing; not being, but becoming; not rest, but exercise. We are not now what we shall be, but we are on the way; the process is not yet finished, but it has begun; this is not the goal, but it is the road; at present all does not gleam and glitter, but everything is being purified.

— Martin Luther 

### Luther, father of Reformation

#### The personification of the Reformation?

Who was this person who stands so huge at the beginning of our period?

<https://prezi.com/yfmiihckhjj0/martin-luther-reformation/>

- near contemporary = Columbus discovering new world
- as **nominalist** he taught that with help of grace we earn our own salvation
- **Purgatory** as a concept and related **indulgences**
- 95 theses
- L. gained support from humanists (Renaissance) &#x2013; cf. Erasmus

#### Excerpts from Luther\'s \"Freedom of a Christian\"

- <https://sites.google.com/site/relg317f15/>
- <http://richard-hooker.com/sites/worldcultures/REFORM/FREEDOM.HTM>
- A Christian man is the most free lord of all, and subject to none, a Christian man is the most dutiful servant of all, and subject to every one.
- \"faith has appeared to many to be an easy thing\"
- \"Man is composed of a twofold nature, a spiritual and a bodily.\"
- (recognizing that scriptural passages can be found to seem to support opposites perspectives)
- outward signs (vestments etc.) \"profit nothing\"
- \"One thing, and one alone, is necessary for life, justification, and Christian liberty; and that is the most holy word of God, the Gospel of Christ.\"
- this faith can reign only in the inward man
- every Christian by faith if \"lord of all things\" but in \"corporeal power\" he is subject to the earthly powers
- the \"outward man\" ... must not take his ease; ... exercise, fastings, etc. 
- enormous folly ... when a man seeks, without faith, to be justified and saved by works...
- ceremonies are but \"preparations for building or working\" to be \"laid aside.\"

#### Excerpts from presentations

- One of the major things I learned while reading this chapter is that Luther was resposible for many of the critical changes in the church. Specifically, his emphasis on faith. Luther stressed the fact that faith because of the many instances of corruption in the Catholic church.
- The debate over the Spirit or Holy Spirit was really interesting to me. Andreas Bodenstein von Carlstadt, a colleague of Luther, \"thought that the voice of the Holy Spirit could speak directly to any Christian\" (p. 158), in which Luther thought this was not a good idea, since Luther believed that Scripture was more important.
- Thomas Muntzer also believed that the Spirit was more important than Scriptures, claiming that \"the Spirit could speak even to those who lacked the education needed for biblical scholarship\" (p. 158).
- I found it surprising how discouraging Luther was towards political rebellion. I mean, I disagree with his ideals of people living for simplicity of the common good. If there is not change present, then corruption continues. I would think Luther would want reformation of the corruption of the church intertwined with the political system.
- It wasn\'t as surprising as it was interesting to discover the origin of Mennonites (or the Amish as I thought). It is weird to think that something as simple as adult baptism really separated Christians. I could really see the importance of scripture as the highest authority because people have their own views on how to interpret scripture. Luther seemed as if he wanted to take it literally, but he holds many contradictions to this. \"
- Luther addresses in the excerpt that everyone has a priesthood but not everyone can perform ceromonies Are the ceromonies he is speaking of sacraments, like baptism and communion? If so, what does he mean by that?
- Being saved by faith alone surprised me because I was taught that faith means: \"a strong belief in God or in the doctrines of a religion, based on spiritual apprehension rather than proof.\" And my youth pastor used to say that he has no faith the bible is real, he knows it.
- Luther did not expect his beliefs about the authority of scripture to be viewed as rebellious and heretical! It was also viewed as quite shocking that he got married.
- Humanists were mentioned in this chapter, but I struggled to fully comprehend what they believed and how it differed from the Orthodox Church (as well as Luther\'s teachings).
- Luther changed the entire christian theology by standing his ground and calling out the wrong doings of the church. I also found it important when Luther stated that even without the bible one can come to know Christianity on a spiritual level just as those who wrote the bible did before them.
- If a person does not know God and is of a certain age we consider them to be saved still if they die young. This theory of Luthers would imply that anyone can know God without proper exposure and therefore could potentially distroy the original belief.
- Luther\'s revolution was accidental, -- Grebel and friends rebaptism of one another after deciding that infant baptisms are invalid.\"
- I was surprised that such a thing as Christian mysticism exists. Eckhart\'s theory risked blurring the distinction between God and His creatures, so that humans could be considered divine through their connection with God. This reminded me of the Hindu philosophy that all individual souls are one united, divine being.

### Humanists

#### Thomas More:

- *Utopia* from Grk "ou" + "topos" (no place)
- Martyred by Henry VIII

### Erasmus

Several quotes to illustrate \"Humanism\"

- cf. <http://oll.libertyfund.org/people/desiderius-erasmus>
- need for a philosopher of the kitchen
- for peace and against war

#### Erasmus quotes

- There are some people who live in a dream world, and there are some who face reality; and then there are those who turn one into the other.
- By a Carpenter mankind was made, and only by that Carpenter can mankind be remade.
- Now I believe I can hear the philosophers protesting that it can only be misery to live in folly, illusion, deception and ignorance, but it isn\'t -it\'s human.
- He who allows oppression shares the crime.
- In praise of folly (in Latin a play on words dedicated to his friend
  Thomas More) Could be **In praise of More**
- Opening lines, spoken with dripping irony: <https://www.gutenberg.org/files/30201/30201-h/30201-h.htm>

#### Compare Luther & Erasmus

- Erasmus sought to clear away corruption and restore simple ethical Christianity

- Luther's conservatism on social issues
  
  ### Zurich and Zwingli

- Z. shared L.'s desire for reform, but different emphasis

- Z. started with absolute authority of scripture

- Z. partly allied with Erasmus in desire to cleanse the church

- Z. and L. in different political environments (princedom vs. democracy)

- eucharist *consubstantiation* vs. *symbolize*

### Other developments

#### Radical Reformation

#### infant baptism?

#### Thomas Munzer

- (trust in Spirit) conflict with Luther … 
- he saw the end times and 2nd Coming

#### The Schleitheim Confession Of Faith, 1527

- a People set apart (sect)
- the \"ban\"
- a \"remembrance\" for the holy people
- the \"sword\" is for the world, not the holy people

### Sacraments

 3 Competing Definitions

#### Luther

- Consubstantiation
- by the power of God both Christ and bread and wine present

#### Zwingli

- (mere) symbol
- Humanist focus on the human effects, language

#### Sacrament is ...

\"Outward and visible sign of an inward and invisible grace\"

- one substance (Christ) with \"accidents\" (manifestations, \"outward appearance\") of bread and wine
- But the power of God cannot be so determined and measured
- In view of these passages we are compelled to confess that the words: \"This is my body,\" should not be understood naturally, but figuratively,
- option: not to define the \"presence\"

##### cf. ch. 14 for Zwinglian developments

##### justification by faith (though we remain sinners) cf. P. Wismer's analogy re. looking at the board of writing but "seeing" a clean board

##### continued debate about the role of grace and our participation with it

##### increasingly "faith" meant an "assent to a set of propositions." p. 167

#### radical reformation

- an "odd collection of pacificsts and violent revolutionaries, eccentric individualists and tightly knit communities, biblical literalists and those who followed the inner voice of the Spirit"
- anabaptists ("rebaptizers")

### Trent

- Transubstantiation
- Universal = Christ, outward appearance = bread and wine

## 4. Ch. 13: Counter Reformation

### 13 Catholic Reformation

#### questions and focus

##### read Erasmus

##### "authority" and scripture, tradition

##### Read Don Quixote? What have to do with Christian thought? Knighthood? Chivalry? "Good citizen"

##### read Pascal: wager, end of logic?

##### what is "pietism"

#### epithoughts

##### Erasmius yielded to Loyola (desire for reform)

##### response of Church "a more militant, less tolerant church"

### Counter Reformation

### 5 themes

#### Humanity and Divinity of Christ:

1. how fit the Catholic humanists in this?

#### Reason and revelation: (What is true? Path to salvation?)

1. cf. bible and tradition vs. bible alone

#### Works and Grace:

1. maintaining a tension,
2. cp. Contarini with similar exp. to Luther

#### Spirit and Structure: canons and \"reforms\" aimed at structure,

1. cf. also the turmoil over Carmelites

#### Church and State:

1. nb that German Lutherans overthrew state authority, tradition that
   state followed ruler,
2. Rome pretensions to the Roman Empire (left over from high middle
   ages synthesis)

### Council of Trent

- laid foundation for reform
- Scripture and tradition equally
- L. had said original sin destroyed will, Catholics sought compromise
- Justification as a \"process\" not instantaneous as L. thought
- Sacraments and reform: 7 sacraments, transubstantiation, sacrifice on altar repeated, purgatory and indulgences (but warned re. abuse)
- p\. 173 notion of \"justification\" which many thought as a kind of property people have or don\'t,
- L. \"no righteousness of our own but only share in Christ\'s righteousness\"
- Trent set forth doctrinal statements on
  - Scripture and tradition,
  - original sin,
  - justification, and the
  - sacraments that have provided the basis of Catholic theology ever since,\"

#### Jesuits and mystics

- Don Quixote and Loyola (Knight for Christ)
- S.J. sending missionaries world wide, adapting to customs of people they met
- Carmelites (John and Teresa)

#### Continuing debates

- Jesuits at center of response to Protestantism

- \"Aquinas had taught that we talk about God \"analogically\"

- Port Royal Jansenists -- rigorous piety and trust in grace as opposed to Jesuits whom they saw as \"Pelagian\"

- Pascal: genius of age ... conversion \"Fire, God of Abraham ...\" trust in grace while being well trained in reason as mathematician

- Pascal defense of Christianity, but ultimately Pope ruled against Jansenist radical trust in grace (not own will)

- Fenelon, \"Quietism\", Mme. Guyon = claiming that usual rules don\'t apply because of special relationship with God
  
  ### Council of Trent

- p. 173 notion of "justification" which many thought as a kind of property people have or don't, &#x2013; L. "no righteousness of our own but only share in Christ's righteousness"

- Trent set forth doctrinal statements on Scripture and tradition, original sin, justification, and the sacraments that have provided the basis of Catholic theology ever since," laid foundation for reform

* Justification as a "process" not instantaneous as L. thought

* Sacraments and reform: 7 sacraments, transubstantiation, sacrifice on altar repeated, purgatory and indulgences (but warned re. abuse)
  
  Going forward from the 16th c.
  ==============================

### Teresa

- cf. from *Readings* p. 38 a **road to training and forming oneself in the path of prayer at the deepest level**

### Pascal:

- Blaise Pascal was one of the most important scholars of the 17th century. He was a great scientist, mathematician, and inventor, famous for many key breakthroughs. He was also a devoted Catholic and wrote what is considered to be one of the best apologetic works of his time.

::: {.NOTES}
But he wasn\'t always a believer. After spending most of his life only nominally interested in religion, he had a dramatic conversion -- and it was due to an incredible and dramatic mystical experience.\ <https://churchpop.com/2016/04/19/night-fire-blaise-pascals/> - It was November 23rd, 1654 and Pascal was at home alone. The sun was set and all was dark. He was most likely preparing for bed when, suddenly, at around 10:30pm, something supernatural happened. It\'s not clear exactly what he saw, but the amazing mystical experience lasted for a full two hours. As soon as it was over, he grabbed a pen and paper and wrote down what was swirling through his head.

Here\'s what he wrote:\
The year of grace 1654,

Monday, 23 November, feast of St. Clement, pope and martyr, and others in the martyrology. Vigil of St. Chrysogonus, martyr, and others. From about half past ten at night until about half past midnight,

FIRE.

GOD of Abraham, GOD of Isaac, GOD of Jacob\
not of the philosophers and of the learned.\
Certitude. Certitude. Feeling. Joy. Peace.\
GOD of Jesus Christ.\
My God and your God.\
Your GOD will be my God.\
Forgetfulness of the world and of everything, except GOD.\
He is only found by the ways taught in the Gospel.\
Grandeur of the human soul.\
Righteous Father, the world has not known you, but I have known you.\
Joy, joy, joy, tears of joy.\
I have departed from him:\
They have forsaken me, the fount of living water.\
My God, will you leave me?\
Let me not be separated from him forever.\
This is eternal life, that they know you, the one true God, and the one
that you sent, Jesus Christ.\
Jesus Christ.\
Jesus Christ.\
I left him; I fled him, renounced, crucified.\
Let me never be separated from him.\
He is only kept securely by the ways taught in the Gospel:\
Renunciation, total and sweet.\
Complete submission to Jesus Christ and to my director.\
Eternally in joy for a day\'s exercise on the earth.\
May I not forget your words. Amen.

Wow! Whatever he saw, it sounds amazing.

He then took the piece of paper with the story and carefully sewed it into the inside of his jacket, which he kept with him the rest of his life. This was not discovered until after his death.
:::

### Closing

When we read the Reformers from the perspective Protestantism it seems relatively straightforward. In the context of all that was going on including the Catholic perspective it is a lot less clear.

**Keep in mind that we don\'t even consider here the Orthodox view.** which is older than Catholicism.

#### Jesuits and mystics

##### Don Quixote and Loyola (Knight for Christ)

##### S.J. sending missionaries world wide, adapting to customs of people they met

#### Geneva

- Europe being divided up
- Radical reformation in pockets
- Calvin inherited what Zwingli had begun
- looked on as \"the Protestant Rome\"


#### Catholic point of view

<http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03195b.htm> This link provides a distinctly catholic perspective

#### Calvin's Emphasis

- where Luther\'s emphasis on grace and justification
- Calvin on covenant (in the lineage of Abraham)
- the government of society bound up with notion of covenant

  deacons ... \"presbytery\"


#### Calvinism

- clear & systematic mind at work
- overpowering sense of God\'s glory
- Plato: we sin out of ignorance. Calvin: we are ignorant because of sin
- not so much Luther\'s law & Gospel / standing in a continuous **covenant** from Abraham
- **predestination**
- obedience to constituted authority
- Calvin Luther built on his personal conversion
  - Calvin was private and rarely personal, rather logical
- Luther sin and need for justification
  - Calvin God\'s glory and power
- Law and gospel
  - vs Covenant (Abraham)
- Calvin: God's grace alone saves us, but in gratitude we then try to do God's will. Sanctification before justification
- Being saved by God\'s grace alone leads to a doctrine of predestination Surely it is not by good works but God\'s doing completely
- Contrary to Luther and Zwingli he preferred to be vague about nature of presence in Eucharist
- Regulate morality? Punish those who don\'t prove to be reformed?  Church maintains discipline?

#### Calvin & Sacraments

- importance of Martin Bucer as a bridge figure
- insisting on Christ\'s presence (not a particular understanding)
- the church regulating its own life (discipline)
- normalcy of church/state overlap

#### Knox & Arminius

- possibility? necessity? to rebel against authority that demands
  betrayal of faith

- Arminians argued that one could refuse grace -- in opposition to
  predestination of Calvinism (cf. p. 194)

::: {.NOTES}
Notes:

Note how when one focuses on just one truth, the overall whole gets
distorted.

  it as a reliable guide to the interpretation of Scripture, while the
  Puritans wanted to read their Bibles unencumbered by traditional
  assumptions.\"

- Oliver Cromwell and again the mixing of politics and religion
