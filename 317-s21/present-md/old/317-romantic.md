### Feuerbach

-   Gospels consist of \"myths\"
-   \"to treat the Gospels as historically accurate would be to take
    metaphors and images as literal truth.\"

    the point, however, is to *change it*.

    more bigoted, more gloomy, more fierce in its religion, than at
    present it shows itself to be.\"
