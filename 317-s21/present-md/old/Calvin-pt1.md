Calvin
======

-   clear & systematic mind at work
-   overpowering sense of God\'s glory
-   Plato: we sin out of ignorance. Calvin: we are ignorant because of
    sin
-   not so much Luther\'s law & Gospel / standing in a continuous
    **covenant** from Abraham
-   **predestination**
-   obedience to constituted authority

::: {.NOTES}
Notes:

Compare Luther & Calvin

-   Calvin Luther built on his personal conversion
    -   Calvin was private and rarely personal, rather logical
-   Luther sin and need for justification
    -   Calvin God\'s glory and power
-   Law and gospel
    -   vs Covenant (Abraham)
-   Calvin: God's grace alone saves us, but in gratitude we then try to
    do God's will. Sanctification before justification
-   Being saved by God\'s grace alone leads to a doctrine of
    predestination Surely it is not by good works but God\'s doing
    completely
-   Contrary to Luther and Zwingli he preferred to be vague about nature
    of presence in Eucharist
-   Regulate morality? Punish those who don\'t prove to be reformed?
    Church maintains discipline?
:::

Sacraments
----------

-   importance of Martin Bucer as a bridge figure
-   insisting on Christ\'s presence (not a particular understanding)
-   the church regulating its own life (discipline)
-   normalcy of church/state overlap

Knox & Arminius
===============

-   possibility? necessity? to rebel against authority that demands
    betrayal of faith
-   prophets to denounce injustice & call to action (Knox in Scotland)
-   Arminians argued that one could refuse grace -- in opposition to
    predestination of Calvinism (cf. p. 194)

::: {.NOTES}
Notes:

Note how when one focuses on just one truth, the overall whole gets
distorted.

Reformation in England
======================

-   <http://sermons-fr-hathaway.blogspot.com/2017/10/anglican-talkmd.html>
    for a talk I gave at the Oratory last fall
-   divorce? leading to separation from Pope\'s authority
-   Lutheran, Calvinist, Catholic
-   Thomas Cranmer & \*Book of Common Prayer
-   39 articles allowing for various readings
-   Richard Hooker: \"thoughtful & moderate\"

From Puritans to Quakers
========================

-   Puritan party reacting to the conservative (i.e.
    not-sufficiently-reformed aspects of Elizabethan/Hooker compromise
-   all practice and belief must stem from New Testament
-   material success a sign of Grace?
-   voice of C of E: William Laud, John Donne, Lancelot Andrewes
-   Hooker argued that \"tradition\" has an important part to play in
    authority of the Church
-   authority reside in Scripture alone? or
-   in inner **experience**? -- Society of Friends (Quakers)
