  This life, therefore, is not righteousness, but growth in
  righteousness; not health but healing; not being, but becoming; not
  rest, but exercise. We are not now what we shall be, but we are on the
  way; the process is not yet finished, but it has begun; this is not
  the goal, but it is the road; at present all does not gleam and
  glitter, but everything is being purified.

- [[https://sites.google.com/site/relg317f15/]]

- A Christian man is the most free lord of all, and subject to none, a
  Christian man is the most dutiful servant of all, and subject to every
  one.
- "faith has appeared to many to be an easy thing"
- "Man is composed of a twofold nature, a spiritual and a bodily."
- (recognizing that scriptural passages can be found to seem to support
  opposites perspectives)
- outward signs (vestments etc.) "profit nothing"
- "One thing, and one alone, is necessary for life, justification, and
  Christian liberty; and that is the most holy word of God, the Gospel
  of Christ."
- this faith can reign only in the inward man
- every Christian by faith if "lord of all things" but in "corporeal
  power" he is subject to the earthly powers
- the "outward man" ... must not take his ease; ... exercise, fastings,
  etc.
- enormous folly ... when a man seeks, without faith, to be justified
  and saved by works...
- ceremonies are but "preparations for building or working" to be "laid
  aside."

***** Excerpts from presentations
      :PROPERTIES:
      :CUSTOM_ID: excerpts-from-presentations
      :END:

- One of the major things I learned while reading this chapter is that
  Luther was resposible for many of the critical changes in the church.
  Specifically, his emphasis on faith. Luther stressed the fact that
  faith because of the many instances of corruption in the Catholic
  church.
- The debate over the Spirit or Holy Spirit was really interesting to
  me. Andreas Bodenstein von Carlstadt, a colleague of Luther, "thought
  that the voice of the Holy Spirit could speak directly to any
  Christian" (p. 158), in which Luther thought this was not a good idea,
  since Luther believed that Scripture was more important.
- Thomas Muntzer also believed that the Spirit was more important than
  Scriptures, claiming that "the Spirit could speak even to those who
  lacked the education needed for biblical scholarship" (p. 158).
- I found it surprising how discouraging Luther was towards political
  rebellion. I mean, I disagree with his ideals of people living for
  simplicity of the common good. If there is not change present, then
  corruption continues. I would think Luther would want reformation of
  the corruption of the church intertwined with the political system.
- It wasn't as surprising as it was interesting to discover the origin
  of Mennonites (or the Amish as I thought). It is weird to think that
  something as simple as adult baptism really separated Christians. I
  could really see the importance of scripture as the highest authority
  because people have their own views on how to interpret scripture.
  Luther seemed as if he wanted to take it literally, but he holds many
  contradictions to this. "
- Luther addresses in the excerpt that everyone has a priesthood but not
  everyone can perform ceromonies Are the ceromonies he is speaking of
  sacraments, like baptism and communion? If so, what does he mean by
  that?
- Being saved by faith alone surprised me because I was taught that
  faith means: "a strong belief in God or in the doctrines of a
  religion, based on spiritual apprehension rather than proof." And my
  youth pastor used to say that he has no faith the bible is real, he
  knows it.
- Luther did not expect his beliefs about the authority of scripture to
  be viewed as rebellious and heretical! It was also viewed as quite
  shocking that he got married.
- Humanists were mentioned in this chapter, but I struggled to fully
  comprehend what they believed and how it differed from the Orthodox
  Church (as well as Luther's teachings).
- Luther changed the entire christian theology by standing his ground
  and calling out the wrong doings of the church. I also found it
  important when Luther stated that even without the bible one can come
  to know Christianity on a spiritual level just as those who wrote the
  bible did before them.
- If a person does not know God and is of a certain age we consider them
  to be saved still if they die young. This theory of Luthers would
  imply that anyone can know God without proper exposure and therefore
  could potentially distroy the original belief.
- Luther's revolution was accidental, -- Grebel and friends rebaptism of
  one another after deciding that infant baptisms are invalid."
- I was surprised that such a thing as Christian mysticism exists.
  Eckhart's theory risked blurring the distinction between God and His
  creatures, so that humans could be considered divine through their
  connection with God. This reminded me of the Hindu philosophy that all
  individual souls are one united, divine being.

- Now I believe I can hear the philosophers protesting that it can only
  be misery to live in folly, illusion, deception and ignorance, but it
  isn't -it's human.
- He who allows oppression shares the crime.
- In praise of folly (in Latin a play on words dedicated to his friend
  Thomas More) Could be *In praise of More*

Blaise Pascal was one of the most important scholars of the 17th
century. He was a great scientist, mathematician, and inventor, famous
for many key breakthroughs. He was also a devoted Catholic and wrote
what is considered to be one of the best apologetic works of his time.

::: {.NOTES} But he wasn't always a believer. After spending most of his
life only nominally interested in religion, he had a dramatic conversion
-- and it was due to an incredible and dramatic mystical experience.
[[https://churchpop.com/2016/04/19/night-fire-blaise-pascals/]] - It was
November 23rd, 1654 and Pascal was at home alone. The sun was set and
all was dark. He was most likely preparing for bed when, suddenly, at
around 10:30pm, something supernatural happened. It's not clear exactly
what he saw, but the amazing mystical experience lasted for a full two
hours. As soon as it was over, he grabbed a pen and paper and wrote down
what was swirling through his head.

Here's what he wrote: The year of grace 1654,

Monday, 23 November, feast of St. Clement, pope and martyr, and others
in the martyrology. Vigil of St. Chrysogonus, martyr, and others. From
about half past ten at night until about half past midnight,

FIRE.

GOD of Abraham, GOD of Isaac, GOD of Jacob not of the philosophers and
of the learned. Certitude. Certitude. Feeling. Joy. Peace. GOD of Jesus
Christ. My God and your God. Your GOD will be my God. Forgetfulness of
the world and of everything, except GOD. He is only found by the ways
taught in the Gospel. Grandeur of the human soul. Righteous Father, the
world has not known you, but I have known you. Joy, joy, joy, tears of
joy. I have departed from him: They have forsaken me, the fount of
living water. My God, will you leave me? Let me not be separated from
him forever. This is eternal life, that they know you, the one true God,
and the one that you sent, Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. I
left him; I fled him, renounced, crucified. Let me never be separated
from him. He is only kept securely by the ways taught in the Gospel:
Renunciation, total and sweet. Complete submission to Jesus Christ and
to my director. Eternally in joy for a day's exercise on the earth. May
I not forget your words. Amen.

Wow! Whatever he saw, it sounds amazing.

He then took the piece of paper with the story and carefully sewed it
into the inside of his jacket, which he kept with him the rest of his
life. This was not discovered until after his death.

Compare Luther & Calvin

- Calvin Luther built on his personal conversion

  - Calvin was private and rarely personal, rather logical

- Luther sin and need for justification

  - Calvin God's glory and power

- Law and gospel

  - vs Covenant (Abraham)

- Calvin: God's grace alone saves us, but in gratitude we then try to do
  God's will. Sanctification before justification
- Being saved by God's grace alone leads to a doctrine of predestination
  Surely it is not by good works but God's doing completely
- Contrary to Luther and Zwingli he preferred to be vague about nature
  of presence in Eucharist
- Regulate morality? Punish those who don't prove to be reformed? Church
