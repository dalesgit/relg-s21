## Excerpts from Luther's "Freedom of a Christian" ##

- <http://richard-hooker.com/sites/worldcultures/REFORM/FREEDOM.HTM>
- A Christian man is the most free lord of all, and subject to none, a Christian man is the most dutiful servant of all, and subject to every one.
- "faith has appeared to many to be an easy thing"
- "Man is composed of a twofold nature, a spiritual and a bodily."
- (recognizing that scriptural passages can be found to seem to support opposites perspectives)
- outward signs (vestments etc.) "profit nothing"
- "One thing, and one alone, is necessary for life, justification, and Christian liberty; and that is the most holy word of God, the Gospel of Christ."
- this faith can reign only in the inward man
- every Christian by faith if "lord of all things" but in "corporeal power" he is subject to the earthly powers
- the "outward man" ... must not take his ease; ... exercise, fastings, etc. 
- enormous folly ... when a man seeks, without faith, to be justified and saved by works...
- ceremonies are but "preparations for building or working" to be "laid aside."

# Humanists #

## Thomas More: ##

- lawyer, noted *humanist*, and defender of the Catholic Church
- *Utopia* from Grk "ou" + "topos" (no place)
- This work epitomizes More as *humanist* -- it recognizes that ultimately one's moral principles will come into conflict with social mores
- Martyred by Henry VIII for not supporting Henry's efforts to wrest control of the church from Rome

## Erasmus ##

Several quotes to illustrate "Humanism"

- cf. <http://oll.libertyfund.org/people/desiderius-erasmus>
- need for a philosopher of the kitchen
- for peace and against war

## Erasmus quotes ##

- There are some people who live in a dream world, and there are some who face reality; and then there are those who turn one into the other.
- By a Carpenter mankind was made, and only by that Carpenter can mankind be remade.
- Now I believe I can hear the philosophers protesting that it can only be misery to live in folly, illusion, deception and ignorance, but it isn't -it's human.
- He who allows oppression shares the crime.
- In praise of folly (in Latin a play on words dedicated to his friend
  Thomas More) Could be **In praise of More**
- Opening lines, spoken with dripping irony: <https://www.gutenberg.org/files/30201/30201-h/30201-h.htm>

## Notes ##

- an "odd collection of pacificsts and violent revolutionaries, eccentric individualists and tightly knit communities, biblical literalists and those who followed the inner voice of the Spirit"
- anabaptists ("rebaptizers")
- the impact is more far-reaching than immediately significant, affecting society up to the present day
