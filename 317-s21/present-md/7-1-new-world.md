-   many Deists brought to bear on the biblical miracle stories all the
    prestige of the scientific discovery of laws
-   deists distrusted appeals to authority and the miraculous, but they
    also turned away from anything beyond natural religion in part for
    moral reasons.

## Pietists and Methodists ##


-   "**enthusiasm**" was a dirty word in the eighteenth century.
-   story begins in germany, where lutheran orthodoxy had increasingly
    defined faith as assent to a set of doctrines
-   Lutherans suspect any call to moral improvement as a move toward
    works-righteousness.
-   Methodism with a "method" for holiness
-   wesley and Whitefield changed the shape of popular religion in
    England and North America, but they made little impact on the
    attitudes among most intellectuals

## the end of reason ##

-   Hume
-   Rousseau
-   Kant
