# English Reformation #

## Reformation in England ##

- author disputes that Henry VIII "started" Anglican church
- tradition of reform went back a century or more
- Thomas Cranmer as Archbishop was the prime mover --
- particularly in focus on worship and *The Book of Common Prayer* (together with the later emerging *King James Bible*)
- *Lex orandi, lex credendi* is a fundamental character of Anglicanism (relation between worship and belief)
- "Anglican (195) could hold any theology from near Catholic to Calvinist"

## From Puritans to Quakers ##

- Puritans to "purify" the church -- particularly with regard to worship (only scripture)
- "purifying" church, worked hard and saved their money
- as "character" working hard (capitalism, spirit of U.S.) -- cf.  because of impact on US
- Puritans and Capitalism (Weber)
- Anglicans who reacted to Puritans: John Donne, William Laud, Lancelot Andrewes, **Richard Hooker** and the *via media*
- (p. 197) "Hooker did not accept the Roman Catholic position that tradition has an authority independent of Scripture, but he did use it as a reliable guide to the interpretation of Scripture, while the Puritans wanted to read their Bibles unencumbered by traditional assumptions."
- Oliver Cromwell and again the mixing of politics and religion
- moderate and radical Puritans -- radical appealing to individual experience (of Spirit) cf. Quakers (George Fox)

- material success a sign of Grace?
- voice of C of E: William Laud, John Donne, Lancelot Andrewes
- Hooker argued that "tradition" has an important part to play in authority of the Church
- authority reside in Scripture alone? or in inner **experience**? -- Society of Friends (Quakers)

## Knox & Arminius ##

- possibility? necessity? to rebel against authority that demands
  betrayal of faith
- prophets to denounce injustice & call to action (Knox in Scotland)
- Arminians argued that one could refuse grace -- in opposition to
  predestination of Calvinism (cf. p. 194)

Notes:

Note how when one focuses on just one truth, the overall whole gets
distorted.

### Predestination ###

- clearly we are not saved by good works, therefore it has to be God's decision
- "Reflections on how we come to be saved led to the doctrine of predestination (189 ff.)
- single? double?
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Private_Memoirs_and_Confessions_of_a_Justified_Sinner> for an interesting fictional application of the principle
