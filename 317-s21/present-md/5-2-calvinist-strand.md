- a "civil" use of law as well as "theological" (188)


::: {.NOTES}
Notes:

Compare Luther & Calvin

- Calvin Luther built on his personal conversion
  - Calvin was private and rarely personal, rather logical
- Luther sin and need for justification
  - Calvin God's glory and power
- Law and gospel
  - vs Covenant (Abraham)
- Calvin: God's grace alone saves us, but in gratitude we then try to
  do God's will. Sanctification before justification
- Being saved by God's grace alone leads to a doctrine of
  predestination Surely it is not by good works but God's doing
  completely
- Contrary to Luther and Zwingli he preferred to be vague about nature
  of presence in Eucharist
- Regulate morality? Punish those who don't prove to be reformed?
  Church maintains discipline?
