## Questions and issues ##

- new worlds were beginning to show up on the horizon, Asia and North America
- there was a spirit of discovery in science, literature, art, technology, cosmically even
- "reform" implies what? A wide-spread sense that things were in need of being reshaped, renewed, reframed -- politically, economically, scientifically, etc.

## epigram re. we are "becoming" ##

> This life, therefore, is not righteousness, but growth in righteousness; not health but healing; not being, but becoming; not rest, but exercise. We are not now what we shall be, but we are on the way; the process is not yet finished, but it has begun; this is not the goal, but it is the road; at present all does not gleam and glitter, but everything is being purified. â€” Martin Luther
