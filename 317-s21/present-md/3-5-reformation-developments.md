# Philosophical issues #

## Nominalism vs. Realism (philosophical concepts) ##

- Realism: Universals are "real"
- Nominalism: The only thing "real" are the names we put on things
- the really real vs. knowing the individual rather than the universal
- cf. John Duns Scotus
  
  ##### William of Ockham: showing reason's limitations

- Ockham (God can do anything)
- Ockham's "razor": argued the simpler explanation is to be preferred
- Particulars are all that we experience and "know"
- Ockham's "razor"
