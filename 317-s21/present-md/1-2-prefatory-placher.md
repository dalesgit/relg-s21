# Prefatory to reading Placher #

## Placher's approach  ##

- his particular attention to how Christians interpret the Bible
- insistence on **theological interpretation of Scripture** (helping to bridge divides in Christendom)
- "Placher's **postliberal (post-modern)** approach (to theology and experience) 
- providing a way to critically appropriate the best of postmodern thought while avoiding the weaknesses" (xiv)

## Post-liberal ##

This methodology shares a conviction that the ""modern"" period is over and that we must move past it

* thus our theology can not be "foundational",  based on **universal** claims of rationality
* Lindbeck and Frei are important figures in this approach
* Placher is aware of  the many "deadends" of typical "modern"approach to truth in biblical interpretation (xv)
* Barth became in 70's great postliberal inspiration
* major emphasis on " **conversation**" (narrativity)
