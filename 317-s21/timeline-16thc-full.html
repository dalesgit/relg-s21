<li>1501  The world has a population of around 435 million – about one-fourteenth today's population of 6.4 billion.</li>
<li>1501  A military Sufi order in Persia known as the Safavids have survived Timur (Tamerlane) and have adopted the Shia branch of Islam. They have been eager to advance Shi'ism by military means. They seize Tabriz in western Iran and make it their capital. They believe in the glory of their king (shah) and in the old tradition of passing rule and religious righteousness from father to son.</li>
<li>1502  Christopher Columbus begins his fourth and last journey to the Caribbean. He still believes that the islands he has found lay off the coast of India.</li>
<li>1504  Machiavelli is in France, learning about the strength of a nation united under a single ruler rather than under various centers of power.</li>
<li>1506  In the city of Lisbon, on April 19, religiously empassioned Christians slaughter nearly 4,000 Portuguese Jews.</li>
<li>1506  May 20: Columbus dies in Spain.</li>
<li>1509  A Dutch humanist, Desiderius Erasmus, writes In Praise of Folly. He is a devout Catholic who has been bothered by what he calls absurd superstitions of most of the Christians of his day. He favors the translation of the Bible from Latin to local languages so that the masses can read it, and he believes that common people have the capacity to understand Christianity as well as do priests.</li>
<li>1510  Portuguese ships are heavily armed with cannon and dominate the Indian Ocean. Indian ships are smaller and held together with coconut fiber ropes, instead of iron nails. Portuguese Catholics establish a presence at the port at Goa on India's western coast, a point from which Muslims had been debarking for pilgrimages to Arabia. Goa begins to serve as Portugal's port and capital town in Asia. India these days has a population of around 105 million – about one-twelfth the number of people in Pakistan and India today.</li>

<li>1512  Three sons of the aged Ottoman Sultan Bayezid II are fighting for his throne. Janissaries are a power behind the throne and choose the most warlike of the three: Selim. He eliminates all potential future successor claimants except his favorite son.</li>
<li>1512  Michelangelo finishes the Sistine Chapel.</li>
<li>1514  The Ottoman sultan, Selim – a Sunni – defeats the Shah of Iran, Isma'il.  Isma'il – a Shia – has been accustomed to victory, and he and his Safavid followers believed that Allah was on their side. They are bewildered by their defeat. Isma'il finds relief from depression in wine. Selim annexes Diyarbekir and Kurdistan.</li>
<li>1514  Portuguese traders reach what today is Indonesia, then the center of spice production.</li>
<li>1517  A Portuguese ship arrives at Guangzhou (Canton) in southern China.</li>
<li>1517  The Ottoman sultan, Selim, with superior weaponry, routes the Mamluks.  It is the end of Egypt's Mamluk sultans. The last of them is hanged. Selim appoints a viceroy to rule Egypt as pasha. Egypt will now acknowledge Ottoman suzerainty and pay annual tribute to the Ottoman sultan.</li>
<li>1517  An Augustinian friar and professor of theology, Martin Luther, lists his 95 theses.</li>
<li>1519  Gold mining in Hispaniola has dwindled. The value of gold is still relatively high among Spaniards, and a search for gold elsewhere in the New World begins. Spain's authority in the Americas sends Hernando Cortez on a mission to Mexico.</li>
<li>1520  Luther has refused to retract some of his protests. He has been printing pamphlets explaining his position. The papacy orders Luther's works burned.</li>
<li>1520  Sweden is free from the rule of Danish kings,</li>
<li>1520  Henry VIII of England and King Francis of France, each with army behind him, meet on June 7. They dismount and embrace in one of the world's earlier summit meetings. There will be celebrations and sermons on the virtues of peace.</li>

<li>1521 Charles V has been elected as the Holy Roman Emperor, and Pope Leo X allies himself with Charles against Martin Luther. Francis of France does not like Charles – a Habsburg. The Italian War begins with Francis invading Navarre and the low countries. Francis is allied with the Republic Venice. England's Henry VIII sides with Charles and the Papal States.</li>

The people of Tenochtitlan have no guns and are weakened by small pox. Their supply of water is cut. They are killed by the thousands and defeated.</li>
<li>1522  Suleiman sends an armada of 400 ships and more than 100,000 men to Rhodes. He is using artillery and explosives. Rhodes capitulates after a siege of 145 days.</li>
<li>1525  In Italy, King Francis of France is defeated at the Battle of Pavia. Francis is taken prisoner and many of his chief nobles are killed. France fails to regain territories in Italy.</li>
<li>1526  The printing press is introduced in Stockholm, Sweden.</li>
<li>1526  From Kabul a Muslim tribal leader, Babur, has been making a series of raids through the Khyber Pass into the Indus Valley, seeking plunder. He has found opposition forces weak, and at Panipat (about fifty miles north of Delhi, he routes the forces of the Sultan Ibrahim Lodi – an Afgan who has ruled much of India since 1489.</li>
<li>1526  Suleiman the Great defeats an army led by King Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia, near Mohács, about 150 kilometers south of Buda and Pest. King Louis falls under his horse into a river and drowns.</li>
<li>1527  Machiavelli dies of ill health never seeing the unification of Italy that he desired.</li>
<li>1527  In South America a small pox epidemic devastates the Inca people of Cusco. Five years of civil war begin over which of two sons is to succeed the now dead king, Huayna Capac.</li>
<li>1529  From the Muslim town of Adal in what today is Somalia, Ahmad ibn Ghazi has been leading a jihad against the Ethiopian Christian emperor Anbasa Segad. According to the Ethiopian Royal Chronicles, Emperor Segad has 16,000 cavalry and 200,000 infantry. Grazni is victorious with 560 cavalry,12,000 soldiers and firearms. In coming years the Muslims will plunder southern Ethiopia, burn churches and monasteries and compel Christians to convert.</li>
<li>1529  Suleiman sends an army from Hungary against Vienna: 325,000 men, 90,000 camels and 500 artillery pieces. Thousands of camels are lost because of the spring rains and 200 of the heavier artillery pieces are sent back. Suleiman's force finally arrives in late September. Their attempts to get past Vienna's walls fail, and in mid-October they withdraw.</li>

<li>1542  The Ming emperor, Jiajing, has focused on Taoism and immortality, but his spiritualism has not made him worthy in the eyes of eighteen of his concubines. They detest him and conspire to strangle him while he sleeps. All of them are executed except the one who warned the empress.</li>
<li>1542  Ivan, to be known as The Terrible, is twelve-years-old. He entertains himself by dropping dogs from the roof of a Kremlin wall battlement.</li>

<li>1551  In France, the works of Martin Luther, John Calvin and others considered heretics are prohibited. In the cites of Paris, Toulouse, Grenoble, Rouen, Bordeaux and Agners, various heretics and those selling forbidden books have been burned at the stake. Another massacre of Protestants occurs. More than 3,000 Protestants are to be reported as having been killed and 763 houses, 89 stables and 31 warehouses destroyed.</li>
<li>1551  In Geneva, Robert Estienne, also known as Robert Stephanus, is the first to print the Bible divided into standard numbered verses.</li>

<li>1553  Henry's successor, Queen Mary, re-establishes Roman Catholicism as England's state religion.</li>
<li>1554  Queen Mary marries a fellow Catholic – Spain's Habsburg prince, Philip, eleven years her junior. The marriage gives Spain influence in England's affairs.</li>
<li>1555  Philip's father, the Habsburg monarch, ruler of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, concludes the Peace of Augsburg with a  league of Protestant German princes (the Schmalkaldic League).

<li>1555  Humayun has recaptured that part of India that he had inherited from his father, Babur.</li>
<li>1555  French Protestants (Huguenots), running from persecution, are dropped off from three ships at a place that will eventually be called Rio de Janeiro.</li>
<li>1556  Rushing to prayer, Humayun falls down some stairs and dies. His thirteen-year-old-son, Muhammad Akbar, born by an Iranian woman, succeeds him, becoming the third Moghul emperor. With a multi-cultural background he will end Islam as the state religion and declare himself impartial between Islam and Hinduism. He will encourage religious tolerance, art and culture. And he will also expand his empire by military means.</li>
<li>1558  Queen Mary dies and is succeeded by her half-sister, Elizabeth, the daughter of Henry VIII and his second wife, Anne Boleyn. Elizabeth re-establishes Anglican Protestantism as the state religion.</li>
<li>1559  An Italian invents ice cream.</li>
<li>1559  Machiavelli's The Prince appears on the Pope's Index of Prohibited Books. Machiavelli advocated responses in foreign affairs be based on empirical realities and with something other than prayer and Christian love.</li>
<li>1559  Prince Philip is now Philip II of Spain. He appoints his half sister, Margaret, as regent of the Netherlands. She pursues Philip's order to wipe out Protestantism there, and she tries, exercising the common belief that it was a king's prerogative to decide how his subjects should worship. Margaret raises taxes in the Netherlands to finance the intervention, and higher taxes add to the hostility among the people of the Netherlands towards Spanish rule.</li>
<li>1560  Europe is still suffering from periodic epidemics and famines. One-half of all infants born alive are dying before twelve months (as in the poorest countries today). The wealthy might live to between 48 and 56, and the poor, who do not eat as well, might live to 40.</li>
<li>1560  The Portuguese drive the French Huguenots from Rio de Janeiro, killing some of them. Portuguese begin building their own settlement there.</li>
