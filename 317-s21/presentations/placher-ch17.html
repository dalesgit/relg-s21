<p>
Wolfhart Pannenberg (2 October 1928 – 4 September 2014) was a German theologian. He has made a number of significant contributions to modern theology, including his concept of <b>history as a form of revelation centered on the Resurrection of Christ</b>, which has been widely debated in both Protestant and Catholic theology, as well as by non-Christian thinkers.
</p>

<p>
She wrote a large number of books, including <i>Theology for Skeptics: Reflections on God</i>, <i>The Silent Cry: Mysticism and Resistance</i> (2001) and her autobiography <i>Against the Wind: Memoir of a Radical Christian</i> (1999). In <i>Beyond Mere Obedience: Reflections on a Christian Ethic for the Future</i> she coined the term "Christofascist" to describe fundamentalists. Perhaps her best-known work in English was <i>Suffering</i>, which offers a critique of "Christian masochism" and "theological sadism". Sölle's <b>critique is against the assumption that God is all-powerful and the cause of suffering</b>; humans thus suffer for some greater purpose. Instead, God suffers and is powerless alongside us. Humans are to struggle together against oppression, sexism, anti-Semitism, and other forms of authoritarianism.

Notes:
Karl Theodor Jaspers (German: [ˈjaspɐs]; 23 February 1883 – 26 February 1969) was a German-Swiss psychiatrist and philosopher who had a strong influence on modern theology, psychiatry, and philosophy. After being trained in and practicing psychiatry, Jaspers turned to philosophical inquiry and attempted to discover an innovative philosophical system. He was often viewed as a major exponent of existentialism in Germany, though he did not accept the label.

― Ludwig Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus
