* Calvin
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- clear & systematic mind at work
- overpowering sense of God's glory
- Plato: we sin out of ignorance. Calvin: we are ignorant because of sin
- not so much Luther's law & Gospel / standing in a continuous *covenant* from Abraham
- *predestination*
- obedience to constituted authority

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Notes:

Compare Luther & Calvin
- Calvin Luther built on his personal conversion
  - Calvin was private and rarely personal, rather logical
- Luther sin and need for justification
  - Calvin God's glory and power
- Law and gospel
  - vs Covenant (Abraham)
- Calvin: God’s grace alone saves us, but in gratitude we then try to do God’s will. Sanctification before justification
- Being saved by God's grace alone leads to a doctrine of predestination Surely it is not by good works but God's doing completely
- Contrary to Luther and Zwingli he preferred to be vague about nature of presence in Eucharist
- Regulate morality? Punish those who don't prove to be reformed? Church maintains discipline?
#+END_NOTES
** Sacraments
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- importance of Martin Bucer as a bridge figure
- insisting on Christ's presence (not a particular understanding)
- the church regulating its own life (discipline)
- normalcy of church/state overlap
* Knox & Arminius
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- possibility? necessity? to rebel against authority that demands betrayal of faith
- prophets to denounce injustice & call to action (Knox in Scotland)
- Arminians argued that one could refuse grace -- in opposition to predestination of Calvinism (cf. p. 194)

Notes:

Note how when one focuses on just one truth, the overall whole gets distorted.
