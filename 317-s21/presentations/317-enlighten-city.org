* From Enlightenment to a New world
** Locke and Deists
   - Nearly all the attitudes of the time came together in John Locke
   - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kItXvJLnTtk 
   - Many Deists brought to bear on the biblical miracle stories all the prestige of the scientific discovery of laws
   - Deists distrusted appeals to authority and the miraculous, but they also turned away from anything beyond natural religion in part for moral reasons.

** Pietists and Methodists

    - "*Enthusiasm*" was a dirty word in the eighteenth century.
    - story begins in Germany, where Lutheran orthodoxy had increasingly defined faith as assent to a set of doctrines
    - Lutherans suspect any call to moral improvement as a move toward works-righteousness.
    - Methodism with a "method" for holiness
    - Wesley and Whitefield changed the shape of popular religion in England and North America, but they made little impact on the attitudes among most intellectuals

** The end of Reason
   - Hume
   - Rousseau
   - Kant
*** COMMENT Reason and christian thought

Read from p. 216: Ambivalence of these thinkers 

* City on a hill
** The city on a hill
