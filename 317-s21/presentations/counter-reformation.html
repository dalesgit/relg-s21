<ul>
<li>Blaise Pascal was one of the most important scholars of the 17th
century. He was a great scientist, mathematician, and inventor,
famous for many key breakthroughs. He was also a devoted Catholic and
wrote what is considered to be one of the best apologetic works of
his time.</li>

<p>
But he wasn't always a believer. After spending most of his life only
nominally interested in religion, he had a dramatic conversion &#x2013; and it
was due to an incredible and dramatic mystical experience.<br />
<a href="https://churchpop.com/2016/04/19/night-fire-blaise-pascals/">https://churchpop.com/2016/04/19/night-fire-blaise-pascals/</a> - It was
November 23rd, 1654 and Pascal was at home alone. The sun was set and
all was dark. He was most likely preparing for bed when, suddenly, at
around 10:30pm, something supernatural happened. It's not clear exactly
what he saw, but the amazing mystical experience lasted for a full two
hours. As soon as it was over, he grabbed a pen and paper and wrote down
what was swirling through his head.
</p>

<p>
Here's what he wrote:<br />
The year of grace 1654,
</p>

<p>
Monday, 23 November, feast of St. Clement, pope and martyr, and others
in the martyrology. Vigil of St. Chrysogonus, martyr, and others. From
about half past ten at night until about half past midnight,
</p>

<p>
FIRE.
</p>

<p>
GOD of Abraham, GOD of Isaac, GOD of Jacob<br />
not of the philosophers and of the learned.<br />
Certitude. Certitude. Feeling. Joy. Peace.<br />
GOD of Jesus Christ.<br />
My God and your God.<br />
Your GOD will be my God.<br />
Forgetfulness of the world and of everything, except GOD.<br />
He is only found by the ways taught in the Gospel.<br />
Grandeur of the human soul.<br />
Righteous Father, the world has not known you, but I have known you.<br />
Joy, joy, joy, tears of joy.<br />
I have departed from him:<br />
They have forsaken me, the fount of living water.<br />
My God, will you leave me?<br />
Let me not be separated from him forever.<br />
This is eternal life, that they know you, the one true God, and the one
that you sent, Jesus Christ.<br />
Jesus Christ.<br />
Jesus Christ.<br />
I left him; I fled him, renounced, crucified.<br />
Let me never be separated from him.<br />
He is only kept securely by the ways taught in the Gospel:<br />
Renunciation, total and sweet.<br />
Complete submission to Jesus Christ and to my director.<br />
Eternally in joy for a day's exercise on the earth.<br />
May I not forget your words. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Wow! Whatever he saw, it sounds amazing.
</p>

<p>
He then took the piece of paper with the story and carefully sewed it
into the inside of his jacket, which he kept with him the rest of his
life. This was not discovered until after his death.

When we read the Reformers from the perspective Protestantism it seems
relatively straightforward. In the context of all that was going on
including the Catholic perspective it is a lot less clear.
</p>

<p>
<b>Keep in mind that we don't even consider here the Orthodox view.</b> which
is older than Catholicism.
