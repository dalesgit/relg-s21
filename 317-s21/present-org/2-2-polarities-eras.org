** 5 continuums / themes playing out over the centuries
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: 5-continuums--themes-playing-out-over-the-centuries
   :END:

We will return again and again in the course to these themes laid out by
Placher

1. Humanity and Divinity of Christ
2. Reason and revelation
3. Works and Grace
4. Spirit and Structure
5. Church and State

*** Humanity and Divinity of Christ
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: humanity-and-divinity-of-christ
    :END:

- the early centuries of the Common Era were marked by debates
- as the Reformation unfolded and created itself, this polarity became a
  distinguishing marker

*** Reason and Revelation
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: reason-and-revelation
    :END:

- /Faith/ and /Scripture/ became watchwords for the Reformation
- The Catholic tradition would have to wrestle with the /sola fide/ and
  the /sola scriptura/

*** Works and Grace
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: works-and-grace
    :END:

- Luther's opening salvo in the Reformation was aimed at this theme,
  claiming that the tradition represented a form of salvation by works
  rather than salvation by grace
- Something to watch throughout the unfolding modern era is how much one
  side or the other is emphasized

*** Spirit and Structure
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: spirit-and-structure
    :END:

- throughout the modern period there emerged periodically "charismatic"
  movements, emphasizing "spirit" over "structure"
- whenever such renewals engage the tradition there is tension over how
  to maintain the spiritual without structure

*** Church and State
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: church-and-state
    :END:

- in most religious communities there is either an examined or an
  assumed relationship between the authority of the church and the
  authority of the state
- within the emerging Reformation tradition there are some communities
  that understand there to be strong connections between the two and
  some that understand the relationship must be kept distance
- the two pillars of the early Protestant era represent two contrasting
  positions, Luther and Calvin

** Cultural eras
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: cultural-eras
