** Aim of the presentation

- The aim of this presentation is not to go *deeply* into the vast
  expansion of knowledge and understanding of creation over the last 500
  + years
- Some of it will be familiar to you, some of it, perhaps, will not be
- Goal is to suggest the vast impact all of this has on the development
  of *Church Thought*
- especially during the period covered by this course


* Rapid expansion of knowledge
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rapid-expansion-of-knowledge
   :END:

- Buckminster Fuller's data, shown here in gray, displays his estimate
  for the doubling rate for accumulated knowledge.

- The time scale begins with Johannes Gutenberg, who lived from
  approximately 1398 to 1468, and ends in the 1970s. Doubling scale is
  the inverse of the time required to see the volume of accumulated
  knowledge double. As emphasized by the black dashed arrow, the
  doubling rate increased dramatically during the twentieth century.

*Calculus*, originally called *infinitesimal calculus* or "the calculus
of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal][infinitesimals]]", is
the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics][mathematical]] study of
continuous change, in the same way that
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry][geometry]] is the study of
shape and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra][algebra]] is the
study of generalizations of
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_operations][arithmetic
operations]].
** It has two major branches,
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_calculus][differential
calculus]] and
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_calculus][integral calculus]];
the former concerns instantaneous rates of change, and the slopes of
curves, while integral calculus concerns accumulation of quantities, and
areas under or between curves.
