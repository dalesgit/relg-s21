* Development of Knowledge and Theology



The Rev. Dale C. Hathaway

March 23, 2021

** Goals

- The aim of this presentation is not to go **deeply** into the vast expansion of knowledge and understanding of creation over the last 500 + years
- Some of it will be familiar to you, some of it, perhaps, will not be
- Goal is to suggest the vast impact all of this has on the development of **Church Thought**
- especially during the period covered by this course



** Rapid expansion of knowledge



- Buckminster Fullerâ€™s data, shown here in gray, displays his estimate for the doubling rate for accumulated knowledge.

- The time scale begins with Johannes Gutenberg, who lived from approximately 1398 to 1468, and ends in the 1970s. Doubling scale is the inverse of the time required to see the volume of accumulated knowledge double. As emphasized by the black dashed arrow, the doubling rate increased dramatically during the twentieth century.

* Astronomy

*Copernicus*

** Perspective of our place in the world

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance][Renaissance]]-era mathematician, astronomer, and Catholic [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(priest)][canon]] who formulated a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model][model]] of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_spheres#Renaissance][the universe]] that placed [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism][the Sun rather than
Earth]] at its center


** Where is the center?
#+REVEAL_HTML: <img class="stretch" src="https://gnosticwarrior.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Symbols-Jerusalem-map.jpg" alt="drawing" />



** Global perspective

 #+REVEAL_HTML: <img class="stretch" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Globe_Atlantic.svg/894px-Globe_Atlantic.svg.png" alt="drawing" />

We understand that on the surface of a globe there is no center



** Implication for theology

- Christianity is not the only religion on the planet or in history or in the universe
- Theology must take seriously the morality of how we treat the earth
- Interpretation of Genesis 1 -- "Stewards of creation" or "Lords of creation"




* Leibnitz / Newton

*Calculus*, originally called *infinitesimal calculus* or "the calculus of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal][infinitesimals]]", is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics][mathematical]] study of continuous change, in the same way that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry][geometry]] is the study of shape and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra][algebra]] is the study of generalizations of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_operations][arithmetic operations]].

It has two major branches, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_calculus][differential calculus]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_calculus][integral calculus]]; the former concerns instantaneous rates of change, and the slopes of curves, while integral calculus concerns accumulation of quantities, and areas under or between curves.

** Precise measurement:
- Calculate navigating to the Orbiting Space Station, trip to the moon, etc.
- Google Maps navigation



** Implication for theology

- measurements and claims in historical documents, including the Bible

- some have gone so far as to explain religion in terms of psychological forces

 #+REVEAL_HTML: <img class="stretch" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Complex_systems_organizational_map.jpg/1024px-Complex_systems_organizational_map.jpg" alt="drawing" />

** simple description

*Systems thinking* is the ability or skill to perform problem solving in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system][complex systems]]. A system is an entity with interrelated and interdependent parts; it is defined by its boundaries and is more than the sum of its parts (subsystem). Changing one part of the system affects other parts and the whole system, with predictable patterns of behavior.


** Implication for theology

- proverbially statement from Chaos theory that "a butterfly in China has an impact on a hurricane in North America"
- inter-relationship of all things is now both a scientific as well as a religious reality



* Chemistry

 #+REVEAL_HTML: <img class="stretch" src="https://sites.google.com/a/iitrpr.ac.in/iitropar-chemistry/_/rsrc/1506420597557/Home/29-chemistry.jpg" alt="drawing" style="width:400px;"/>

The *periodic table*, also known as the *periodic table of elements*, is a tabular display of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element][chemical elements]], which are arranged by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number][atomic number]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_configuration][electron configuration]], and recurring [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_property][chemical properties]]. (Wikipedia)

** Impact


Beginning in the 18th c. the relationships between elements began to be understood, culminating in the periodic table,




- our way of life is impossible to imagine without the results of vast chemical knowledge
- the changes fashioned on humanity and on the earth are vast and difficult to fathom
- "The future is plastic" from the movie *The Graduate*
- it has played its part in the development of vaccines



** Implication for theology

- taking into account how unseen matters affect the visible world



* Medicine

 #+REVEAL_HTML: <img class="stretch" src="https://college.mayo.edu/media/mccms/content-assets/academics/school-of-medicine/MD-program-3312647-0094-hero-desktop.jpg" alt="drawing" />




- changed the modern world, life-expectancy, comfort, convenience
- brought new and unexpected realities to human life: birth-control, transplants, surgery, treatment for disease



** Implication for theology

- moral questions that are seen in a new light



* In summary
- How do we interpret the Bible
- It is impossible now to deny that theology has developed (Newman)
- Christianity cannot think of itself as triumphant
- traditional morality is inadequate from a number of perspectives.


** And

- how is it possible to incorporate religious perspectives from other cultures and religions
- doctrinal statements and positions were developed through interplay of cultural, social, and political forces.
- to maintain that all truth is found in the Bible seems untenable -- yet it is firmly maintained by some
- theology can no longer be done in a vacuum without interaction with all these disciplines

** And

- some Christian traditions are clearly more open than others to the truth claims of empirical evidence
- exploitation understood as sin
- complicity in violence and genocide
