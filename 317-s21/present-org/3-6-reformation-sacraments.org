#### Sacraments ####

 3 Competing Definitions

##### Luther #####

- Consubstantiation
- by the power of God both Christ and bread and wine present

##### Zwingli #####

- (mere) symbol
- Humanist focus on the human effects, language

##### Sacrament is ... #####

\"Outward and visible sign of an inward and invisible grace\"

- one substance (Christ) with \"accidents\" (manifestations, \"outward appearance\") of bread and wine
- But the power of God cannot be so determined and measured
- In view of these passages we are compelled to confess that the words: \"This is my body,\" should not be understood naturally, but figuratively,
- option: not to define the \"presence\"
