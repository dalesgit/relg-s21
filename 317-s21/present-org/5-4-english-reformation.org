- Anglicans who reacted to Puritans: *John Donne*, *William Laud*, *Lancelot Andrewes*, *Richard Hooker* and the /via media/

- overall impact of these developments on the United States
- Puritans and Capitalism (20th c. scholar: Weber)
- Oliver Cromwell and the mixing of politics and religion
* Knox & Arminius
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: knox-arminius
  :END:

- possibility? necessity? to rebel against authority that demands betrayal of faith
- prophets to denounce injustice & call to action (Knox in Scotland)
- Arminians argued that one could refuse grace -- in opposition to predestination of Calvinism (cf. p. 194)

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Notes:

Note how when one focuses on just one truth, the overall whole gets
distorted.

Compare touching an elephant blind-folded

   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: predestination
   :END:

- clearly we are not saved by good works, therefore it has to be God's decision
- "Reflections on how we come to be saved led to the doctrine of predestination (189 ff.)
- single? double?
