[*] In 2001 Ray Kurzweil wrote "The Law of Accelerating Returns" which posited that during the 21st century humanity would experience 20,000 years of progress instead of 100. This is possible because the rate of change of technology is undergoing "double" exponential growth, that is, exponential growth. <a href="https://www.industrytap.com/new-paradigms-the-exponential-growth-of-knowledge/53192">new paradigms</a>

[*] in 1894, the scientist Albert Michelson said, "While it is never safe to affirm that the future of Physical Science has no marvels in store even more astonishing than those of the past, it seems probable that most of the grand underlying principles have been firmly established and that further advances are to be sought chiefly in the rigorous application of these principles to all the phenomena which come under our notice. It is here that the science of measurement shows its importance &#x2014; where quantitative work is more to be desired than qualitative work. An eminent physicist remarked that the future truths of physical science are to be looked for in the sixth place of decimals."
