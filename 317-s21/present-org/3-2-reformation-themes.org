*** Justification by faith alone
    - foundational belief of Reformation
    - "works" are a fruit of faith
    - growing out of Luther's experience
    - the established church (Western Catholic, Eastern Orthodox) never argued the opposite i.e. justification by works alone
** Sola Gratia
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: sola-gratia
   :END:
#+reveal_html: <img class="stretch" src="https://onewaychristiancenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sola-Gratia.jpg">
** 
- salvation is accomplished entirely by God's grace, not our doing
- even the benefits or fruit of God's grace working in us, does not effect salvation
** Sola Scriptura
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: sola-scriptura
   :END:
#+reveal_html: <img class="stretch" src="https://onewaychristiancenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sola-Scriptura.jpg">
** 
- scripture is the primary source of authority
- scripture should be used to interpret scripture
- pitted against the authority of "*tradition*", or later in the Anglican tradition a 3rd category of "experience"

** Law vs. Gospel
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: law-vs-gospel

** a "Polarity" of the Reformation
- this is typically used to contrast the standards, authority, and effectiveness of the old covenant vs. the new covenant
- Luther established the pattern of using the contrast as a standard for interpreting scripture
* Authority
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: authority
  :END:
- the nature, range, source, extent of *authority* has been consistently a part of theology controversy from the earliest days of the church
- it raises issues of political vs. spiritual authority
- it raises local vs. global (i.e. "catholic") tensions
- in the context of the reformation it pits the authority of *scripture* vs. the authority of the *church* or the authority of "*tradition*"
* Free will and Predestination
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: free-will-and-predestination
  :END:
- this polarity seems very modern, where "free will" seems self-evident
- contemporary science continues to provide less self-evident evidence that all might be determined
- the Reformation provides considerable background to the debate
- both Luther and Calvin provided strong arguments intended to contrast the fallen nature of human will vs. majesty of God's will
