#+BEGIN_NOTES
Compare Luther & Calvin

- Calvin Luther built on his personal conversion
- Calvin was private and rarely personal, rather logical
- Luther sin and need for justification
- Calvin God's glory and power
- Law and gospel
- vs Covenant (Abraham)

- Calvin: God's grace alone saves us, but in gratitude we then try to do God's will. Sanctification before justification
- Being saved by God's grace alone leads to a doctrine of predestination Surely it is not by good works but God's doing completely
- Contrary to Luther and Zwingli he preferred to be vague about nature of presence in Eucharist
- Regulate morality? Punish those who don't prove to be reformed? Church maintains discipline?
- the government of society bound up with notion of covenant
- a "civil" use of law as well as "theological" (188)
