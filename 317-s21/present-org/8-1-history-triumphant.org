#+BEGIN_NOTES

::: {.NOTES} Note: From my youth I would reflect that no one in all of human history could think the thoughts I do, imagine what I imagine. I somehow looked toward Africa, reflecting that my vantage point was toward Africa not the other way round. That I had learned the things I learned in school -- from my ancestors -- that I thought in an English way, not French or Albanian or whatever.

Moreover, the experience of History class in High School. Historical knowledge is never knowledge *with certainty*. :::
