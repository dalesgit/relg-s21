### Triumphant sense of history presentations ###

#### Europe Rejecting the Enlightenment ####

-   Different course from that taken in America

::: {.NOTES}
Note: How did America move past the Enlightenment?

Locke etc. -- Deism Great Awakening -- embracing \"enthusiasm\",
conversion over \"natural theology\" Unitarians, Emerson, Slavery?
:::

##### Placement along various continua #####


-   Traditional \<---\> Progressive
-   Catholic \<---\> Protestant
-   Open to Science \<---\> Reactive or rejecting
-   Religious language as literal \<---\> Figurative

##### Definitions #####


-   Romanticism: p.233 *change is not always for the best, appreciate
    national traditions, value feeling over scientific analysis*
-   **Not** \"natural theology\": p. 205 *the basic truths about the
    existence of God and human morality known to good people in all
    societies*

##### New awareness of History #####


-   Rise of historical criticism since Renaissance
-   Skepticism of **knowing** with certainty (Spinoza, Hume, Kant, rise
    of scientific method)

::: {.NOTES}
Note: From my youth I would reflect that no one in all of human history
could think the thoughts I do, imagine what I imagine. I somehow looked
toward Africa, reflecting that my vantage point was toward Africa not
the other way round. That I had learned the things I learned in school
-- from my ancestors -- that I thought in an English way, not French or
Albanian or whatever.

Moreover, the experience of History class in High School. Historical
knowledge is never knowledge **with certainty**.
:::

#### Romantic era ####

![Building Foundations](https://thefunambulistdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/undergroundbydavidmacaulay001.jpg)

##### ch. 17, trust in history #####

#### 2 Romantics ####


##### Schleiermacher #####


-   religion as a **feeling** not **thought** \"feeling of absolute
    dependence\"
-   every event is a miracle, a \"sign\"
-   revelation is \"every original and new communication of the Universe
    to man\"
-   embrace the \"genius\" of one\'s own tradition

##### Coleridge #####


-   **tradition** is not conservatism but interpreting Christianity in
    terms of Romanticism
-   \"factual accuracy of the Bible does not matter\" but whether it
    **finds me**

#### Hegel ####


##### Structure of Reality & How we can know it #####

- ![](http://www.cam.ac.uk/sites/www.cam.ac.uk/files/styles/content-580x288/public/news/research/news/120905-georg-wilhelm-friedrich-hegel-wikimedia-commons.jpg?itok=1upCC102)
- everything we see and experience is bound by historical setting
- thus: **How can we know anything with certainty?**
- triadic structure of reality p. 237
- [Overview of Hegel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q54VyCpXDH8&feature=youtu.be)
- [30 min. more in depth on Hegel](http://www.openculture.com/2015/08/the-half-hour-hegel.html)




##### David Strauss #####


- until Strauss, miracles either:
    - happened as described (literal) or
    - some \"rational\" explanation or
    -\"fraud\"
- Strauss proposed that they consisted of \"myth\" (religious language
    that conveys sacred truth)

##### Ludwig Feuerbach #####


- "theology is anthropology\"
- many college freshman can say, \"God is just a projection of the
    human imagination.\" (a function of low-level thinking? or
    pervasiveness of Feuerbach\'s position)

##### SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard #####

-   writing in pseudonyms to make the point that we always only know
    from a certain perspective
-   \"We understand backwards, but we must live forwards.\"

::: {.NOTES}
Note: Thus Abraham responding to God\'s command to sacrifice Isaac as
seen from an ethical perspective was utterly depraved, justification for
**murder**. \"Only faith can offer a different interpretation... Faith
goes beyond the universal categories of ethics to make the individual
matter again. Only through **absurdity** ... belief in **paradox**.
Anything else made faith to be **trivial**. \"Only paradox can be
grasped with passion.\" (p. 240)

Use the image of \"leap of faith\" in a dancer. Throughout one is only
becoming or reflecting where one has been. Only at one unspeakable
moment is one in **being**.

The aesthetic perspective seeks to understand **love**. Thus is
personal. Personal \<-\> Universal \<-\> Personal again
:::

##### Development of Religious Person for S.K. #####


- **aesthetic** stage
- **ethical** stage
- **religious** stage
    - The \"Knight of Faith\"

![](http://blog.jaluo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/19/unst_fa_2da_files/image006.jpg)

#### Roman Catholic Reaction ####


-   interplay of Church/State authority (Papacy reluctant to abandon)
-   condemnation of \"modernism\" (*Syllabus of Errors*)
-   **immaculate conception** as dogma by means of **papal
    infallibility**
-   Leo XIII & Catholic social justice concerns

##### English Response #####


##### John H. Newman #####


-   recognizing that the Protestant claim to return to apostolic origins
    was fraught with historical perspectives (Hegel)
    -   doctrine had developed from the very beginning of the church
-   \"England would improve \"were it vastly more superstitious, more
    bigoted, more gloomy, more fierce in its religion ...\" p. 242

##### Frederick Maurice #####


-   high church / evangelical wing
-   rejecting both Maurice sought a 3rd alternative, identifying with
    the working class, argued for a gospel that could be embraced by
    **all**
-   Darwin / Huxley couldn\'t explain \"the philosophical and
    theological implications of these new scientific conclusions.\"

#### Liberal Theology ####


-   Albrecht Ritschl
-   Friedrich Nietzsche
-   Adolf Harnack
-   Ernst Troeltsch

::: {.NOTES}
Note: Ritschl tied Christianity closely to the culture of his time,
moving away from metaphysical theories (cp. Maurice re. attacking
emphasis on justification and conversion.

Harnack was his student. History of Christian doctrine -- corruption of
Christ\'s original teaching through Greek influences.

History of religions theologicans like E. Troeltsch concluded
Christianity emerged gradually out of a context of Jewish and middle
eastern religions.

Johannes Weiss and Albert Schweitzer argued that Jesus context had been
**apocalypticism** -- expectation that a cataclysm was approaching and a
**new age** would be ushered in.

Nietzsche: argued that the influence of Christianity had been
**negative**! We are not moving towards **truth** but truth is simply
whatever a society agrees to call \"true\".

Fascination with **history** ending in **despair**?
