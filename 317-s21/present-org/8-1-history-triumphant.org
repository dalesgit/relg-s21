#+BEGIN_NOTES

::: {.NOTES} Note: From my youth I would reflect that no one in all of human history could think the thoughts I do, imagine what I imagine. I somehow looked toward Africa, reflecting that my vantage point was toward Africa not the other way round. That I had learned the things I learned in school -- from my ancestors -- that I thought in an English way, not French or Albanian or whatever.

Moreover, the experience of History class in High School. Historical knowledge is never knowledge *with certainty*. :::

** Schleiermacher
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: schleiermacher
   :END:

- religion as a *feeling* not *thought* "feeling of absolute dependence"
- every event is a miracle, a "sign"
- revelation is "every original and new communication of the Universe to
  man"
- embrace the "genius" of one's own tradition

** Coleridge
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: coleridge

** David Strauss
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: david-strauss

- until Strauss, miracles either:

  - happened as described (literal) or

  that conveys sacred truth)

** Ludwig Feuerbach
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: ludwig-feuerbach
   :END:

- "theology is anthropology"
- many college freshman can say, "God is just a projection of the human
  imagination." (a function of low-level thinking? or pervasiveness of
  Feuerbach's position)

** Søren Kierkegaard
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: søren-kierkegaard
   :END:

- writing in pseudonyms to make the point that we always only know from
  a certain perspective
- "We understand backwards, but we must live forwards."

#+BEGIN_NOTES

::: {.NOTES} Note: Thus Abraham responding to God's command to sacrifice
Isaac as seen from an ethical perspective was utterly depraved,
justification for *murder*. "Only faith can offer a different
interpretation... Faith goes beyond the universal categories of ethics
to make the individual matter again. Only through *absurdity* ... belief
in *paradox*. Anything else made faith to be *trivial*. "Only paradox
can be grasped with passion." (p. 240)

Use the image of "leap of faith" in a dancer. Throughout one is only
becoming or reflecting where one has been. Only at one unspeakable
moment is one in *being*.

The aesthetic perspective seeks to understand *love*. Thus is personal.

- Albrecht Ritschl
- Friedrich Nietzsche
- Adolf Harnack
- Ernst Troeltsch

#+BEGIN_NOTES

::: {.NOTES} Note: Ritschl tied Christianity closely to the culture of
his time, moving away from metaphysical theories (cp. Maurice re.
attacking emphasis on justification and conversion.

Harnack was his student. History of Christian doctrine -- corruption of
Christ's original teaching through Greek influences.

History of religions theologicans like E. Troeltsch concluded
Christianity emerged gradually out of a context of Jewish and middle
eastern religions.

Johannes Weiss and Albert Schweitzer argued that Jesus context had been
*apocalypticism* -- expectation that a cataclysm was approaching and a
*new age* would be ushered in.

Nietzsche: argued that the influence of Christianity had been
*negative*! We are not moving towards *truth* but truth is simply
whatever a society agrees to call "true".

Fascination with *history* ending in *despair*? :::
