  - the destruction of WWI was monumental
  - and the main players were the very cultures that had seemed so confident such a short time before

** Cheap Grace
   The term “cheap grace” can be traced back to a book written by German theologian, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, called The Cost of Discipleship, published in 1937. In that book, Bonhoeffer defined “cheap grace” as “the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance, baptism without church discipline. Communion without confession.[fn:1]
