** Rationality

 - "It may be that universal history is the history of the different intonations given a handful of metaphors." (*)
 - Arguments for God: /a priori/ and /empirical/
 - Calvin's systematic development of the faith position *sovereignty of God*
 - Quakers and Nonconformists: where is highest authority placed?
 - Descartes: from scientific method to rational conclusions

- a tale of 2 earthquakes
- he found the evidence for his belief in nature rather than in the Bible; he doubted a good bit of traditional doctrine---and he didn't treat religion all that seriously.
- Revivals but at heart a move from God to human beings

/Do we explain these by reference to God? No? We are inheritors of Enlightenment/.

- p. 203 it is the *shifting of place* re. God and world --
- what do we pay attention to? What determines our interpretive framework?

** Enlightenment from ...
God-centered to Human-centered

1. 5 catalysts for change (204)
2. wars of religion
3. Europe divided
4. philosophical attitudes encouraged questioning tradition
5. science seemed to being moving from one accomplishment to another ...;
6. nationalism taking root, centralizing power
7. at the very time of success in discovery and technology, reason seemed to reach its end of life
