** 2 Romantics
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: 2-romantics
   :END:
 - as in art, the discovery of native traditions led to new sensitivities about the nature of religion
 - if religion followed individual or cultural patterns, in what sense does it express universal truths?
  
** Schleiermacher
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: schleiermacher
   :END:

- religion as a *feeling* not *thought* "feeling of absolute dependence"
- every event is a miracle, a "sign"
- revelation is "every original and new communication of the Universe to man"
- embrace the "genius" of one's own tradition

** Coleridge
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: coleridge
   :END:

- *tradition* is not conservatism but interpreting Christianity in terms of Romanticism
- "factual accuracy of the Bible does not matter" but whether it *finds me*
* Hegel
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: hegel
  :END:

** Structure of Reality & How we can know it
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: structure-of-reality--how-we-can-know-it
   :END:

- everything we see and experience is bound by historical setting
- thus: *How can we know anything with certainty?*
- triadic structure of reality p. 237
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q54VyCpXDH8&feature=youtu.be][Overview of Hegel]]
- [[http://www.openculture.com/2015/08/the-half-hour-hegel.html][30 min. more in depth on Hegel]]

** David Strauss
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: david-strauss
   :END:

- until Strauss, miracles either:

  - happened as described (literal) or
  - some "rational" explanation or -"fraud"

- Strauss proposed that they consisted of "myth" (religious language
  that conveys sacred truth)

** Ludwig Feuerbach
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: ludwig-feuerbach
   :END:

- "theology is anthropology"
- many college freshman can say, "God is just a projection of the human
  imagination." (a function of low-level thinking? or pervasiveness of
  Feuerbach's position)

** Søren Kierkegaard
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: søren-kierkegaard
   :END:

- writing in pseudonyms to make the point that we always only know from
  a certain perspective
- "We understand backwards, but we must live forwards."

#+BEGIN_NOTES

::: {.NOTES} Note: Thus Abraham responding to God's command to sacrifice
Isaac as seen from an ethical perspective was utterly depraved,
justification for *murder*. "Only faith can offer a different
interpretation... Faith goes beyond the universal categories of ethics
to make the individual matter again. Only through *absurdity* ... belief
in *paradox*. Anything else made faith to be *trivial*. "Only paradox
can be grasped with passion." (p. 240)

Use the image of "leap of faith" in a dancer. Throughout one is only
becoming or reflecting where one has been. Only at one unspeakable
moment is one in *being*.

The aesthetic perspective seeks to understand *love*. Thus is personal.
Personal <-> Universal <-> Personal again :::
