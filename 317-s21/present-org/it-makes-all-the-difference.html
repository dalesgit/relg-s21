<h2 id="org0ed4f59">Introduction</h2>
<p>
I&rsquo;m calling this talk &ldquo;This changes everything.&rdquo; In it I share with you
a handful of &ldquo;ah-hah&rdquo; moments in my life when I have come to the
conclusion that I can&rsquo;t think of Christian theology in the same way any
more. In our final class I wanted to share my thoughts with you as
examples of one person&rsquo;s grappling with the developments of the modern
age. It is not in order to convince you that my conclusions ought to be
your conclusions. I am convinced, however, that contemporary Christian
thought &#x2013; the &ldquo;end&rdquo; of our course this semester &#x2013; can not be done as
&ldquo;business as usual.&rdquo; I hope it will prompt a fitting concluding
conversation for us.

<h2 id="org46d79a8">We understand only backwards &#x2013; but we must Live forwards</h2>
<p>
What is true is more like telling stories and less like philosophical or
scientific propositions.
</p>

<section id="slide-orga5b4ae0">
<h3 id="orga5b4ae0">“God Loves Stories” A Story, as told by Elie Wiesel:</h3>
<p>
When the great Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov saw misfortune threatening the
Jews it was his custom to go into a certain part of the forest to
meditate. There he would light a fire, say a special prayer, and the
miracle would be accomplished and the misfortune averted. Later, when
his disciple, the celebrated Magid of Mezritch, had occasion, for the
same reason, to intercede with heaven, he would go to the same place in
the forest and say: &ldquo;Master of the Universe, listen! I do not know how
to light the fire, but I am still able to say the prayer.&rdquo; And again the
miracle would be accomplished.
</p>

<p>
Still later, Rabbi Moshe-Leib of Sasov, in order to save his people once
more, would go into the forest and say: &ldquo;I do not know how to light the
fire, I do not know the prayer, but I know the place and this must be
sufficient.&rdquo; It was sufficient and the miracle was accomplished. Then it
fell to Rabbi Israel of Rizhyn to overcome misfortune. Sitting in his
armchair, his head in his hands, he spoke to G-d: &ldquo;I am unable to light
the fire and I do not know the prayer; I cannot even find the place in
the forest. All I can do is to tell the story, and this must be
sufficient.” And it was sufficient.
</p>

<p>
G-d made man because He loves stories.
</p>

<p>
So begins Elie Wiesel&rsquo;s famous book, “Gates of the Forest.” -

<h3 id="orgc34550f">The quote is from the first theologian I encountered in college,</h3>
<p>
Søren Kierkegaard. Placher treats him as a reaction to Hegel. He gave the
world the concept of &ldquo;Christendom&rdquo; which is to be contrasted with
&ldquo;Christian faith.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Another theologian of the mid-20th c., John Macquarrie, described the
discipline of theology as &ldquo;God talk&rdquo; &#x2013; i.e. using words to understand
God and God&rsquo;s interaction with humans.
</p>

<p>
If we can only understand &ldquo;looking backwards&rdquo; &#x2013; as we have done in this
course &#x2013; but can only live going forwards &#x2013; i.e. without
understanding, only trust &#x2013; then doing Christian theology is either not
about real life or not about understanding.

<h2 id="org3db007b">What if our understanding of &ldquo;God&rdquo; is wrong?</h2>
<p>
Going back to the beginning of our semester, we looked at various
&ldquo;proofs of the existence of God.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At various points along the way, we have considered &ldquo;theodicy&rdquo;
questions, questions arising out of conflict between the existence of
evil and the profession of belief in an all-powerful and all-loving God.
</p>

<p>
If it is the case that Christian thought has lumbered under the burden
of carrying a Greco-Roman conception of divinity while ignoring the
possibility that such a view of the divine may itself be &ldquo;un-Christian&rdquo;
&#x2013; well, that might make all the difference.&ldquo;
</p>

<p>
There are many in today&rsquo;s environment who have concluded that it is
impossible to defend &ldquo;classical theism&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_theism#:~:text=Classical%20theism%20is%20a%20form,is%20a%20form%20of%20monotheism.">Classical theism</a>

<p>
Process theology in the 20th c., descending from the philosophical work
of Whitehead and the theological work of Charles Hartshorne, is the
prominent expression of an alternative to &ldquo;classical theism&rdquo;.

<h3 id="orgef27264">Clearly there is energy being spent on trying to find &ldquo;God-talk&rdquo; that</h3>
<p>
goes beyond the traditions we have inherited. For myself, there is a
fictional image, a narrative expression, that seems more true than any
of the philosophical expressions I have encountered. It comes from the
memoir of the Holocaust, <i>Night</i>, by Elie Wiesel.

<section id="slide-org1e69c98">
<h3 id="org1e69c98">Elie Wiesel <b>Night</b></h3>
<blockquote >
<p>
The best-known scene in Elie Wiesel&rsquo;s book &ldquo;Night&rdquo; is apparently that
of the execution. Three prisoners, two of them adults and the third a
little boy, were hanged at the Buna camp in Auschwitz after being
implicated by the Gestapo in the discovery of a weapons cache. The
adults died immediately. But the little boy, who did not weigh much,
hovered between life and death for more than half an hour.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote >
<p>
&ldquo;Where is God?&rdquo; someone standing behind Wiesel asked, and Wiesel
relates in the book that a voice from inside him replied: &ldquo;Here, He
is. He is hanging here on the gallows.&rdquo;

<p>
What we know? How do we know? What if there is only contextual
knowledge?
</p>

<p>
Math, Physics and sciences of all kinds have traditionally been
intertwined with Theology. There is considerable energy spent in
resisting those interconnections in the modern American context.
</p>

<p>
What we seem to &ldquo;know&rdquo; from a broad perspective is a vast interconnected
universe, from the impossibly small to the impossibly large. But the
impossible is not just possible, but presumed to be real.

<p>
&ldquo;A particle is not a separate entity but a set of relationships.
The world is an interconnected tissue of events, a dynamic unbroken
whole. Scientists are no longer observers but participants. And
physics and mysticism converge in striking parallels, leading back
full circle: A powerful awareness lies dormant in these discoveries
of modern physics. An awareness of the hitherto- unsuspected powers
of the mind to mold reality, rather than the other way around.&rdquo;
