<p>
I&rsquo;m calling this talk &ldquo;This changes everything.&rdquo; In it I share with you
a handful of &ldquo;ah-hah&rdquo; moments in my life when I have come to the
conclusion that I can&rsquo;t think of Christian theology in the same way any
more. In our final class I wanted to share my thoughts with you as
examples of one person&rsquo;s grappling with the developments of the modern
age. It is not in order to convince you that my conclusions ought to be
your conclusions. I am convinced, however, that contemporary Christian
thought &#x2013; the &ldquo;end&rdquo; of our course this semester &#x2013; can not be done as
&ldquo;business as usual.&rdquo; I hope it will prompt a fitting concluding
conversation for us.

What is <b>true</b> is more like telling stories and less like philosophical or

</p>

<p>
There is something essentially &ldquo;narrative&rdquo; about life.

<h3 id="org5a9c2d7">The quote is from the first theologian I encountered in college,</h3>
<p>
Søren Kierkegaard. Placher treats him as a reaction to Hegel. He gave the world the concept of &ldquo;Christendom&rdquo; which is to be contrasted with
&ldquo;Christian faith.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Another theologian of the mid-20th c., John Macquarrie, described the discipline of theology as &ldquo;God talk&rdquo; &#x2013; i.e. using words to understand God and God&rsquo;s interaction with humans.
</p>

<p>
If we can only understand &ldquo;looking backwards&rdquo; &#x2013; as we have done in this course &#x2013; but can only live going forwards &#x2013; i.e. without understanding, only trust &#x2013; then doing Christian theology is either not about real life or not about understanding.

As one of my teachers put it, &ldquo;If that is true it&rsquo;s important.&rdquo;

<h3 id="org3a154fa">“God Loves Stories” A Story, as told by Elie Wiesel:</h3>
<p>
When the great Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov saw misfortune threatening the Jews it was his custom to go into a certain part of the forest to meditate. There he would light a fire, say a special prayer, and the miracle would be accomplished and the misfortune averted. Later, when his disciple, the celebrated Magid of Mezritch, had occasion, for the same reason, to intercede with heaven, he would go to the same place in the forest and say: &ldquo;Master of the Universe, listen! I do not know how to light the fire, but I am still able to say the prayer.&rdquo; And again the miracle would be accomplished.
</p>

<p>
Still later, Rabbi Moshe-Leib of Sasov, in order to save his people once more, would go into the forest and say: &ldquo;I do not know how to light the fire, I do not know the prayer, but I know the place and this must be sufficient.&rdquo; It was sufficient and the miracle was accomplished. Then it fell to Rabbi Israel of Rizhyn to overcome misfortune. Sitting in his armchair, his head in his hands, he spoke to G-d: &ldquo;I am unable to light the fire and I do not know the prayer; I cannot even find the place in the forest. All I can do is to tell the story, and this must be sufficient.” And it was sufficient.
</p>

<p>
G-d made man because He loves stories.

<p>
In a provocative essay on medical ethics, written many years ago, one of my teachers, Stanley Hauerwas, broke with a long history of theological ethics by arguing that we make decisions not on the basis of <b>principles</b> but rather on the basis of the stories we tell of ourselves.
</p>

<p>
Theology should be done more like stories and less like philosophy or science.

<p>
Certain events of the last century, events that occurred with complicity
and often with defenders from the Christian faith, call into question the
traditional authority of the faith.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Holocaust</li>
<li>Genocide of indigenous peoples</li>
<li>Slavery</li>
<li>Global catastrophe</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgf768727">
<h3 id="orgf768727">is Anti-semitism a part of Christianity?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The birth of Christianity arose in the context of separating itself from the parent religion, Judaism. From the beginning, there has been an incipient sense of, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not THAT.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Christians adopted what Jews would call the &ldquo;Bible&rdquo; but called it the &ldquo;Old Testament&rdquo;. The Old testament is done away with and the New replaces it.</li>
<li>The seeds of later virulent anti-semitism can be seen in the New Testament itself.</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
That&rsquo;s a crude and over-simplistic way of putting it, but it expresses
what is I believe a deep conviction of the Christian world-view.
</p>

<p>
e.g. in the letter to the Hebrews, blaming the crucifixion on &ldquo;the Jews&rdquo; in Gospel of John

<ul>
<li>The events of the 20th c. in what is commonly referred to as &ldquo;the Holocaust&rdquo; call into question that basic element of Christianity.</li>
<li>Is it permissible to interpret the &ldquo;Old Testament&rdquo; as &ldquo;pre-figuring&rdquo; the New &#x2013; in the light of Christian complicity in anti-semitism over the course of 2,000 years?</li>

<h3 id="org0ccb075">Slavery and Genocide</h3>
<ul>
<li>Is not the Christian defense of &ldquo;slavery&rdquo; more than just an abomination, but a blight on the whole traditional approach to Christian thought?</li>
<li>Is a neutral stand, or &ldquo;a-political&rdquo; stance, an acceptable position to hold on these issues?</li>

<h3 id="orge62ec02">Global catastrophe</h3>
<ul>
<li>If the world is in a head-long rush to annihilate life as we know it on earth, doesn&rsquo;t Christian thought have something to contribute to that?</li>
<li>These reflections suggest to me that deep self-reflection on the part of Christian theologians is appropriate</li>

<h2 id="org9590696">What if our understanding of &ldquo;God&rdquo; is wrong?</h2>
<p>
Going back to the beginning of our semester, we looked at various &ldquo;proofs of the existence of God.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At various points along the way, we have considered &ldquo;theodicy&rdquo; questions, questions arising out of conflict between the existence of evil and the profession of belief in an all-powerful and all-loving God.
</p>

<p>
If it is the case that Christian thought has lumbered under the burden of carrying a Greco-Roman conception of divinity while ignoring the possibility that such a view of the divine may itself be &ldquo;un-Christian&rdquo; &#x2013; well, that might make all the difference.&ldquo;
</p>

<p>
There are many in today&rsquo;s environment who have concluded that it is impossible to defend &ldquo;classical theism&rdquo;.

<blockquote >
<p>
The best-known scene in Elie Wiesel&rsquo;s book &ldquo;Night&rdquo; is apparently that
of the execution. Three prisoners, two of them adults and the third a
little boy, were hanged at the Buna camp in Auschwitz after being
implicated by the Gestapo in the discovery of a weapons cache. The
adults died immediately. But the little boy, who did not weigh much,
hovered between life and death for more than half an hour.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote >
<p>
&ldquo;Where is God?&rdquo; someone standing behind Wiesel asked, and Wiesel
relates in the book that a voice from inside him replied: &ldquo;Here, He
is. He is hanging here on the gallows.&rdquo;

<li>Process theology in the 20th c., descending from the philosophical work of Whitehead and the theological work of Charles Hartshorne, is the prominent expression of an alternative to &ldquo;classical theism&rdquo;.</li>
<li><p>
Clearly there is energy being spent on trying to find &ldquo;God-talk&rdquo; that goes beyond the traditions we have inherited.

For myself, there is a fictional image, a narrative expression, that seems more true than any of the philosophical expressions I have encountered. It comes from the memoir of the Holocaust, <i>Night</i>, by Elie Wiesel.

What we know? How do we know? What if there is only contextual knowledge?

<p>
Math, Physics and sciences of all kinds have traditionally been intertwined with Theology. There is considerable energy spent in resisting those interconnections in the modern American context.

What we seem to &ldquo;know&rdquo; from a broad perspective is a vast interconnected universe, from the impossibly small to the impossibly large. But the impossible is not just possible, but presumed to be real.

<p>
&ldquo;A particle is not a separate entity but a set of relationships.
The world is an interconnected tissue of events, a dynamic unbroken
whole. Scientists are no longer observers but participants. And
physics and mysticism converge in striking parallels, leading back
full circle: A powerful awareness lies dormant in these discoveries
of modern physics. An awareness of the hitherto- unsuspected powers
of the mind to mold reality, rather than the other way around.&rdquo;
