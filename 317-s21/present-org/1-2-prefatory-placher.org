* Placher's approach
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: plachers-approach
  :END:

- his particular attention to how Christians interpret the Bible
- insistence on *theological interpretation of Scripture* (helping to
  bridge divides in Christendom)
- "Placher's *postliberal (post-modern)* approach (to theology and
  experience)
- providing a way to critically appropriate the best of postmodern
  thought while avoiding the weaknesses" (xiv)

* Post-liberal
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: post-liberal
  :END:

This methodology shares a conviction that the ""modern"" period is over
and that we must move past it

- thus our theology can not be "foundational", based on *universal*
  claims of rationality
- Lindbeck and Frei are important figures in this approach
- Placher is aware of the many "deadends" of typical "modern"approach to
  truth in biblical interpretation (xv)
- Barth became in 70's great postliberal inspiration
- major emphasis on " *conversation*" (narrativity)
