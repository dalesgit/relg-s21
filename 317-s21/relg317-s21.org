*** CHAPTER Luther and the Radical Reformation

- *95 theses*
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The Ninety-Five Theses on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences (original Latin: Disputatio pro declaratione virtutis indulgentiarum) were written by Martin Luther in 1517 and are widely regarded as the initial catalyst for the Protestant Reformation. The disputation protests against clerical abuses, especially nepotism, simony, usury, pluralism, and the sale of indulgences. It is believed that, according to university custom, on 31 October 1517, Luther posted the ninety-five theses, which he had composed in Latin, on the door of All Saints' Church in Wittenberg. However, the fact that the theses themselves were posted on the church door is disputed.

- *Martin Luther* /The Freedom of a Christian/ 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
On the Freedom of a Christian, sometimes also called "A Treatise on Christian Liberty" (German: "Von der Freiheit eines Christenmenschen") (November 1520), was the third of Martin Luther’s major reforming treatises of 1520, appearing after his Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation (August 1520) and the work Prelude on the Babylonian Captivity of the Church (October 1520). This work was originally written Latin then translated into German and developed the concept that as fully forgiven children of God, Christians are no longer compelled to keep God's law; however, they freely and willingly serve God and their neighbors. Luther also further develops the concept of justification by faith. In the treatise, Luther stated, "A Christian is a perfectly free lord of all, subject to none. A Christian is a perfectly dutiful servant of all, subject to all."

- *Ulrich Zwingli* /An Account of the Faith of Zwingli/ 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Huldrych Zwingli[a] or Ulrich Zwingli[b](1 January 1484 – 11 October 1531) was a leader of the Reformation in Switzerland. Born during a time of emerging Swiss patriotism and increasing criticism of the Swiss mercenary system, he attended the University of Vienna and the University of Basel, a scholarly centre of Renaissance humanism. He continued his studies while he served as a pastor in Glarus and later in Einsiedeln, where he was influenced by the writings of Erasmus.

- *Martin Luther* That These Words of Christ, This Is My Body,” etc., /Still Stand Firm Against the Fanatics/ 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
How, if at all, is Christ present in the Eucharist?  The question itself was one of the most hotly contested of the Protestant Reformation.  Though the question is formally a matter of sacramental theology, the answer to the question for the Reformers often rested upon their own Christological presuppositions.  After all, how one understands the relationship between the divine and human natures of Christ, as well as what limits (if any!) one believes should be placed upon the physical body of Jesus, will influence how one understands the possibility of the presence of Christ in the elements of bread and wine.  One could say that Christology sets the ground rules for sacramental theology.

- *George Blaurock* /The Hutterite Chronicle/ 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Hutterite history involves a succession of migrations in search of religious freedom. Over a period of four-and-a-half centuries, they moved from Germany and Austria to Moravia which today is the Czech Republic; from there to Hungary and further south to Transylvania which today is Romania, then north to Kiev in the Ukraine, south to the Molotschna in the Ukraine near Alexandrovsk, Zaporozhie, across the Atlantic to the Dakotas in the United States and finally, during World War I, up to the Canadian Prairies.
http://www.hutterites.org/history/hutterite-history-overview/

Jörg vom Haus Jacob (Georg Cajacob, or George of the House of Jacob), commonly known as George Blaurock[1] (c. 1491 – September 6, 1529), with Conrad Grebel and Felix Manz, was co-founder of the Swiss Brethren in Zürich, and thereby one of the founders of Anabaptism.

- *Thomas Müntzer* /Sermon Before the Princes/ 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The Sermon to the Princes is a sermon apparently delivered by Thomas Müntzer on 13 July 1524, allegedly given to Duke John of Saxony and his advisors in Allstedt, though the circumstances surrounding this event are unclear. The sermon focuses on Daniel 2, a chapter in which Daniel, hostage in Babylon, becomes an adviser to the king because of his ability to interpret dreams. In the sermon, Müntzer presents himself as a new Daniel to interpret the dreams of the princes to them. He interpreted Daniel 2:44 as speaking of the kingdom of God that would consume all earthly kingdoms.

- *Menno Simons* /The Writings of Menno Simons/ 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Menno Simons (1496 – 31 January 1561) was an Anabaptist religious leader from the Friesland region of the Low Countries. Simons was a contemporary of the Protestant Reformers and his followers became known as Mennonites. "Menno Simons" (/ˈmɛnoː ˈsimɔns/) is the Dutch version of his name; the Frisian version is Minne Simens (/ˈmɪnə ˈsimn̩s/), the possessive "s" creating a patronym meaning "Minne, son of Simen".[citation needed] (cf. the English/Scandinavian family names Johnson, Petersen, Olafsson, etc.)

- *The Formula of Concord* 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Formula of Concord (1577) (German, Konkordienformel; Latin, Formula concordiae; also the "Bergic Book" or the "Bergen Book") is an authoritative Lutheran statement of faith (called a confession, creed, or "symbol") that, in its two parts (Epitome and Solid Declaration), makes up the final section of the Lutheran Corpus Doctrinae or Body of Doctrine, known as the Book of Concord (most references to these texts are to the original edition of 1580). The Epitome is a brief and concise presentation of the Formula's twelve articles; the Solid Declaration a detailed exposition. Approved doctrine is presented in "theses"; rejected doctrine in "antitheses." As the original document was written in German, a Latin translation was prepared for the Latin edition of the Book of Concord published in 1584.

Thomas Cajetan (pronounced Ca-'je-tan), also known as Gaetanus, commonly Tommaso de Vio or Thomas de Vio (20 February 1469 - 9 August 1534), was an Italian philosopher, theologian, cardinal (from 1517 until his death) and the Master of the Order of Preachers 1508-18. He was a leading theologian of his day who is now best known as the spokesman for Catholic opposition to the teachings of Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation while he was the Pope's Legate in Wittenberg, and perhaps also among Catholics for his extensive commentary on the Summa Theologica of Thomas Aquinas.[1]

- *Council of Trent* /Decree Concerning Justification/ 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The Council of Trent (Latin: Concilium Tridentinum), held between 1545 and 1563 in Trento (Trent) and Bologna, northern Italy, was one of the Roman Catholic Church's most important ecumenical councils. Prompted by the Protestant Reformation, it has been described as the embodiment of the Counter-Reformation. Four hundred years later, when Saint Pope John XXIII initiated preparations for the Second Vatican Council (Vatican II), he affirmed the decrees it had issued: "What was, still is."

Ignatius of Loyola (Basque: Ignazio Loiolakoa, Spanish: Ignacio de Loyola) (c. October 23, 1491 – July 31, 1556) was a Spanish knight from a local Basque noble family, hermit, priest since 1537, and theologian, who founded the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) and, on 19 April 1541, became its first Superior General. Ignatius emerged as a religious leader during the Counter-Reformation. Loyola's devotion to the Catholic Church was characterized by absolute obedience to the Pope.

The Pensées (literally "thoughts") is a collection of fragments on theology and philosophy written by 17th-century philosopher and mathematician Blaise Pascal. Pascal's religious conversion led him into a life of asceticism and the Pensées was in many ways his life's work. The Pensées represented Pascal's defense of the Christian religion. The concept of "Pascal's Wager" stems from a portion of this work.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
nstitutes of the Christian Religion (Latin: Institutio Christianae religionis) is John Calvin's seminal work of Protestant systematic theology. Highly influential in the Western world[1] and still widely read by theological students today, it was published in Latin in 1536 (at the same time as the English King Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries) and in his native French in 1541 (it was a landmark in the elaboration of the French language in the 16th century to become a national language) with the definitive editions appearing in 1559 (Latin) and in 1560 (French).

John Knox (c. 1514 – 24 November 1572) was a Scottish clergyman, theologian and writer who was a leader of the Protestant Reformation and is considered the founder of the Presbyterian denomination in Scotland. He is believed to have been educated at the University of St Andrews and worked as a notary-priest. Influenced by early church reformers such as George Wishart, he joined the movement to reform the Scottish church. He was caught up in the ecclesiastical and political events that involved the murder of Cardinal Beaton in 1546 and the intervention of the regent of Scotland Mary of Guise. He was taken prisoner by French forces the following year and exiled to England on his release in 1549.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Richard Hooker (March 1554 – 3 November 1600) was an English priest in the Church of England and an influential theologian. He was one of the most important English theologians of the sixteenth century. Scholars disagree regarding Hooker's relationship with what would be called "Anglicanism" and the Reformed theological tradition. Traditionally, he has been regarded as the originator of the Anglican via media between Protestantism and Catholicism. However, a growing number of scholars have argued that he should be positioned in the mainstream Reformed theology of his time, and only sought to oppose extremist Puritans rather than moving the Church of England away from Protestantism.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In The Reasonableness of Christianity as Delivered in the Scriptures, John Locke begins by examining the significance of the Fall and its relation to the teachings of Christ as they are given in the New Testament. Quoting biblical text, he concludes that in Eden, Adam and Eve were in a state of righteousness and immortality. The Fall brought death into the world to all of humanity, but Christ restored all humanity to life, potentially. To gain salvation, one must believe that Jesus was the Messiah and obey God’s commandments.

He calmly presents the massive amount of biblical texts that assume that we are able to make a free choice to believe or not to believe the promise of salvation, unconstrained by a decree of God that determines before hand to elect or not to elect rooted in his sovereign power alone.

- *David Hume* /Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion/
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion is a philosophical work by the Scottish philosopher David Hume. Through dialogue, three philosophers named Demea, Philo, and Cleanthes debate the nature of God's existence. Whether or not these names reference specific philosophers, ancient or otherwise, remains a topic of scholarly dispute. While all three agree that a god exists, they differ sharply in opinion on God's nature or attributes and how, or if, humankind can come to knowledge of a deity.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
William Ellery Channing (April 7, 1780 – October 2, 1842) was the foremost Unitarian preacher in the United States in the early nineteenth century and along with Andrews Norton, (1786-1853), one of Unitarianism's leading theologians. He was known for his articulate and impassioned sermons and public speeches, and as a prominent thinker in the liberal theology of the day. Channing's religion and thought were among the chief influences on the New England Transcendentalists, though he never countenanced their views, which he saw as extreme. The beliefs he espoused, especially within his "Baltimore Sermon[1]" of May 5, 1819, at the ordination of a future famous theologian and educator in his own right, Jared Sparks, (1789-1866), as the first minister (1819-1823) of the newly organized (1817) "First Independent Church of Baltimore" (later the "First Unitarian Church of Baltimore (Unitarian and Universalist)"). Here he espoused his principles and tenets of the developing philosophy and theology of "Unitarianism" resulted in the organization later in 1825 of the first Unitarian denomination in America (American Unitarian Association) and the later developments and mergers between Unitarians and Universalists resulting finally in the Unitarian Universalist Association of America in 1961.

The King Follett discourse, or King Follett sermon, was an address delivered in Nauvoo, Illinois by Joseph Smith, president and founder of the Latter Day Saint Movement, on April 7, 1844, less than three months before his death. The discourse was presented to a congregation of probably more than twenty thousand Latter-day Saints at a general conference held shortly after the funeral service of Elder King Follett, who had died on March 9, 1844, of accidental injuries. The sermon is notable for its claim that God was once a mortal man, and that mortal men and women can become a god (a concept commonly called divinization) through salvation and exaltation. These topics were, and are, controversial, and have received varying opinions and interpretations of what Smith meant. Literary critic Harold Bloom called the sermon "one of the truly remarkable sermons ever preached in America."

He also became influential in the evolution of Higher Criticism, and his work forms part of the foundation of the modern field of hermeneutics. Because of his profound effect on subsequent Christian thought, he is often called the "Father of Modern Liberal Theology" and is considered an early leader in liberal Christianity. The Neo-Orthodoxy movement of the twentieth century, typically (though not without challenge) seen to be spearheaded by Karl Barth, was in many ways an attempt to challenge his influence.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Søren Kierkegaard's theology has been a major influence in the development of 20th century theology. Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855) was a 19th-century Danish philosopher who has been generally considered the "Father of Existentialism". During his later years (1848–1855), most of his writings shifted from being philosophical in nature to being religious.
Kierkegaard's theology focuses on the single individual in relation to an unprovable, yet known God. Many of his writings were a directed assault against all of Christendom, Christianity as a political and social entity. His target was the Danish State Church, which represented Christendom in Denmark. Christendom, in Kierkegaard's view, made individuals lazy in their religion. Many of the citizens were officially "Christians", without having any idea of what it meant to be a Christian. Kierkegaard attempted to awaken Christians to the need for unconditional religious commitment. However he was also against party spirit in religion as well as other areas of study and system building.

The First Vatican Council (Latin: Concilium Vaticanum Primum) was convoked by Pope Pius IX on 29 June 1868, after a period of planning and preparation that began on 6 December 1864. This twentieth ecumenical council of the Catholic Church, held three centuries after the Council of Trent, opened on 8 December 1869 and adjourned on 20 October 1870. Unlike the five earlier General Councils held in Rome, which met in the Lateran Basilica and are known as Lateran Councils, it met in the Vatican Basilica, hence its name. Its best-known decision is its definition of papal infallibility, strongly promoted by the Archibishop Luigi Natoli.

The Council was convoked to deal with the contemporary problems of the rising influence of rationalism, liberalism, and materialism. Its purpose was, besides this, to define the Catholic doctrine concerning the Church of Christ. There was discussion and approval of only two constitutions: the Dogmatic Constitution on the Catholic Faith and the First Dogmatic Constitution on the Church of Christ, the latter dealing with the primacy and infallibility of the Bishop of Rome. The first matter brought up for debate was the dogmatic draft of Catholic doctrine against the manifold errors due to Rationalism.

Harnack traced the influence of Hellenistic philosophy on early Christian writing and called on Christians to question the authenticity of doctrines that arose in the early Christian church. He rejected the historicity of the gospel of John in favor of the synoptic gospels, criticized the Apostles' Creed, and promoted the Social Gospel.

In the 19th century, higher criticism flourished in Germany, establishing the historical-critical method as an academic standard for interpreting the Bible and understanding the historical Jesus (see Tübingen school). Harnack's work is part of a reaction to Tübingen, and represents a reappraisal of tradition.

Ernst Troeltsch is not an easy figure to categorize owing to the breadth of his intellectual interests. He was a German Protestant theologian who made major scholarly contributions to theology, social ethics, philosophy of religion, philosophy of history, and sociology of religion. Troeltsch was preoccupied for much of his academic career with the advent of modern civilization and its implications for Christianity. His scholarly research was driven by a passionate concern for the wellbeing of the church and its relationship to society. Troeltsch perceived that the church in Europe at the dawn of the twentieth century was encountering an entirely new set of social realities in the wake of the Enlightenment: industrialization, urbanization, the emergence of the nation state, and revolutionary intellectual developments in scientific and historical studies. As Troeltsch surveyed the landscape of Europe in the early years of the twentieth century he worried about the present condition and future prospects of western civilization; he did not share the optimism that many of his contemporaries in church and society exhibited. Troeltsch lived to see his worst fears confirmed in the carnage of trench warfare and Germany’s halting attempts to establish a new political settlement in the form of the Weimar Republic following World War One (1914-1918).

Among his most influential books are Moral Man and Immoral Society and The Nature and Destiny of Man, the second of which Modern Library ranked one of the top 20 nonfiction books of the twentieth century. Starting as a minister with working-class and labor class sympathies in the 1920s oriented to theological pacifism, he shifted to neo-orthodox realist theology in the 1930s and developed the theo-philosophical perspective known as Christian realism. He attacked utopianism as ineffectual for dealing with reality, writing in The Children of Light and the Children of Darkness (1944):
"Man's capacity for justice makes democracy possible; but man's inclination to injustice makes democracy necessary."

Bultmann is known for his belief that the historical analysis of the New Testament is both futile and unnecessary, given that the earliest Christian literature showed little interest in specific locations.[1] Bultmann argued that all that matters is the "thatness", not the "whatness" of Jesus, i.e. only that Jesus existed, preached and died by crucifixion matters, not what happened throughout his life.

- *Martin Luther King, Jr*. /Letter from Birmingham Jail/ 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The Letter from Birmingham Jail (also known as "Letter from Birmingham City Jail" and "The Negro Is Your Brother") is an open letter written on April 16, 1963, by Martin Luther King, Jr. The letter defends the strategy of nonviolent resistance to racism. It says that people have a moral responsibility to break unjust laws, and to take direct action rather than waiting potentially forever for justice to come through the courts. Responding to being referred to as an "outsider", he wrote that “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere“.

The letter was widely published and became an important text for the American Civil Rights Movement of the early 1960s.

   - insistence on theological interpretation of Scripture (helping to bridge divides in Christendom)
   - "Placher's postliberal approach (to theology and experience) way to critically appropriate the best of postmodern thought while avoiding ..." (xiv)
   - postliberal (Yale school) shares conviction that modern period is over and must be got past
     - thus not "foundational" based on universal claims of rationality
     - he followed Lindbeck and Frei
     - n.b. the "deadends" of typical approach to truth in biblical interpreation (xv)

*** Nominalism vs. Realism (philosophical concepts)
- the really real vs. knowing the individual rather than the universal
- cf. John Duns Scotus
- William of Ockham: showing reason's limitations
- Ockham's "razor"
*** path to salvation
- reflecting the particular, we contrivute to the salvicfic effect (Pelagian?)
- later Martin Luther was Augustinian trained as nominalist
- Meister Eckhart (God's spark within us) n.b. 14th c. *mystical* traditions (/tradition where metaphysics is more controversial than sex/)

- Z. and L. in different political environments (princedom vs. democracy)
- infant baptism?

- Trent set forth doctrinal statements on Scripture and tradition, original sin, justification, and the sacraments that have provided the basis of Catholic theology ever since," laid foundation for reform
  - Scripture and tradition equally
  - L. had said original sin destroyed will, Catholics sought compromise

**** Notes

I need to go over the understanding of nominalism. pursue the philosophical question how we know things. The author on page 154 identifies nominalism with earning salvation through works. this Luther reacted against.

Nominalism is a metaphysical view in philosophy according to which general or abstract terms and predicates exist, while universals or abstract objects, which are sometimes thought to correspond to these terms, do not exist. There are at least two main versions of nominalism. One version denies the existence of universals tthings that can be instantiated or exemplified by many particular things (e.g., strength, humanity). The other version specifically denies the existence of abstract objects  objects that do not exist in space and time.

Most nominalists have held that only physical particulars in space and time are real, and that universals exist only post res, that is, subsequent to particular things. However, some versions of nominalism hold that some particulars are abstract entities (e.g., numbers), while others are concrete entities  entities that do exist in space and time (e.g., thrones, couches, bananas).

Nominalism is primarily a position on the problem of universals, which dates back at least to Plato, and is opposed to realism the view that universals do exist over and above particulars. However, the name "nominalism" emerged from debates in medieval philosophy with Roscellinus.

The term 'nominalism' stems from the Latin nomen, "name." For example, John Stuart Mill once wrote, that "there is nothing general except names". In philosophy of law, nominalism finds its application in what is called constitutional nominalism


Walkthrough the three proofs about God and get a vote from the class on which one is strongest. 


Prezi of art of the 14th century. illustrating how far away that. Was from modern times.

Prezi on Luther and Wyclef.

Page 154 the author points out that Luther was in controversy with figure after figure. using the figure of Luther against the world.

Read the passage from the source.


The ninety-five theses is his rebuttal against indulgences. indulgences requires a discussion of what purgatory is. The selling of indulgences was at church way of making money.

Erasmus both an  ally and foe.  say something about his humanism. Note that Erasmus was involved in the Greek New Testament. and that Luther provided the German translation.The debate between them in some ways comes down to how they perceive the strength of free will. page 156

Page 157 Scripture alone meant for Luther not the only authority just the highest. 

Focus a question to the class whether we conceive of humans as primarily evil or primarily good.

Page 158 a discussion about Thomas Munzer. he was sympathetic to Luther but placed a greater emphasis on the inner voice of the Spirit then on the Scriptures.

*** Nominalism (wikipedia)
Nominalism is a metaphysical view in philosophy according to which general or abstract terms and predicates exist, while universals or abstract objects, which are sometimes thought to correspond to these terms, do not exist. There are at least two main versions of nominalism. One version denies the existence of universals tthings that can be instantiated or exemplified by many particular things (e.g., strength, humanity). The other version specifically denies the existence of abstract objects  objects that do not exist in space and time.

Most nominalists have held that only physical particulars in space and time are real, and that universals exist only post res, that is, subsequent to particular things. However, some versions of nominalism hold that some particulars are abstract entities (e.g., numbers), while others are concrete entities  entities that do exist in space and time (e.g., thrones, couches, bananas).

Nominalism is primarily a position on the problem of universals, which dates back at least to Plato, and is opposed to realism the view that universals do exist over and above particulars. However, the name "nominalism" emerged from debates in medieval philosophy with Roscellinus.

The term 'nominalism' stems from the Latin nomen, "name." For example, John Stuart Mill once wrote, that "there is nothing general except names". In philosophy of law, nominalism finds its application in what is called constitutional nominalism

**** cf. also 
http://mb-soft.com/believe/txn/nominali.htm
Nominalism is the designation usually applied to any philosophical system, ancient or modern, that denies all objectivity, whether actual or potential, to universals; in other words, nominalists grant no universality to mental concepts outside the mind. In this sense, the philosophical systems of Epicurus, William of Occam, George Berkeley, David Hume, John Stuart Mill, and of contemporary linguistic analysis may be called nominalistic in that they attribute universality only to words (nomina), mental habits, or concepts and maintain the objective existence only of the concrete, individual thing. ...

    - where Luther's emphasis on grace and justification
    - Calvin on covenant (in the lineage of Abraham)
    - the government of society bound up with notion of covenant
    - a "civil" use of law as well as "theological" (188)
***  questions/focus
       	- "reform" as in "reformed life"
       	- organizing society, community
       	- what is community?
       	- 39 articles
       	- "Puritans" 
*** epithoughts
- "Calvinist in polity" -- huge influence on English world
- Knox and Calvin and the "reformed" tradition
- Calvin retreating from France to Geneva
- reading Calvin elicits not an emotional response but a cumulative one from the systematic presentation p 188
- response to (free) grace is a *reformed* life (thus the name)
- in contrast to Luther's distinction between law and gospel, Calvin thought we stood in the same convenant as Abraham (189)
- "Reflections on how we come to be saved led to the doctrine of predestination (189 ff.)
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Private_Memoirs_and_Confessions_of_a_Justified_Sinner
- theology of sacraments: cf. *Martin Bucer* (large influence)
  - sought position between Luther and Zwingli

** 39 A & Westminster
The codification leaves no wiggle room. It constrains not frees. Does it end up defining what God can and can't do?

  - WC is a comprehensive statement, including e.g. Trinity
  - n.b. WC brings in predestination in #2 re. Trinity (glory)
  - WC #5 emphasis on omnipotence and omniscience leads to emphasis on human's failures vs. humanists who would look at human abilities
  - WC #6 so *much* "wrath of God
  - WC #7 re. covenant sounds so legalese
  - WC #9 nb that free will leads to the way humans fall short, not on their great ability
  - WC #10 even infants (of elect) are saved
  - WC #21 no *place* is more holy than any other. Emphasis on preaching -- nb also that Sabbath now means "Sunday"
  - WC #23 duty of Christians to honor civil magistrates
  - WC #24 acknowledge divorce, should marry only like minded (no papists...)
  - WC #25 pope is antichrist
** 39 A
"supererogation" going beyond the call of duty -- main objection of Luther, i.e. that the supererogation of saints accumulates grace that are dispensed in indulgences

obedience to required in e.g. Oxford Univ until mid 19th c. and still req'd of clergy in C of E

  - shorter
  - outline of the very doctrines that have been at issue
  - 24 no speaking in tongues
  - 25 2 sacraments
  - 27 conveys both senses of baptism
  - 28 clearly anti-Rome, but approve range of Protestant responses (and/also *not* either/or)
  - 34 many traditions = recognize issue in British hx cf. Celtic issue of Hilda of Whitby (664)

** Rufus Jones Intro to George Fox
*** Introduction
 There are mysterious moments in the early life of the individual which we call "budding periods." They are incubation crises, when some new power or function is coming into being. The budding tendency to creep, to walk, to imitate, or to speak, is an indication that the psychological moment has come for learning the special operation.

 There are, too, similar periods in the history of the race, mysterious times of gestation, when something new is coming to be, however dimly the age itself comprehends the significance of its travail. These racial "budding periods," like those others, have organic connection with the past. They are life-events which the previous history of humanity has made possible, and so they cannot be understood by themselves.

 The most notable characteristic of such times is the simultaneous outbreaking of new aspects of truth in sundered places and through diverse lives, as though the breath of a new Pentecost were abroad. This dawning time is generally followed by the appearance of some person who proves to be able to be the exponent of what others have dimly or subconsciously felt, and yet could not explicitly set forth. Such a person becomes by a certain divine right the prophet of the period because he knows how to interpret its ideas with such compelling force that he organizes men, either for action or for perpetuating the truth.

 In the life history of the Anglo-Saxon people few periods are more significant than that which is commonly called the Commonwealth period, though the term must be used loosely to cover the span from 1640 to 1660. It was in high degree one of these incubation epochs when something new came to consciousness, and things equally new came to deed. This is not the place to describe the political struggles which finally produced tremendous constitutional changes, nor to tell how those who formed the pith and marrow of a nation rose against an antiquated conception of kingship and established principles of self-government. The civil and political commotion was the outcome of a still deeper commotion. For a century the burning questions had been religious questions. The Church of that time was the result of compromise. It had inherited a large stock of mediæval thought, and had absorbed a mass of mediæval traditions. The men of moral and religious earnestness were bent on some measure of fresh reform. A spirit was abroad which could not be put down, and which would not be quiet. The old idea of an authoritative Church was outgrown, and yet no religious system had come in its place which provided for a free personal approach to God Himself. It has, in fact, always been a peculiarly difficult problem to discover some form of organization which will conserve the inherited truth and guarantee the stability of the whole, while at the same time it promotes the personal freedom of the individual.

 The long struggle for religious reforms in England followed two lines of development. There was on the one hand a well-defined movement toward Presbyterianism, and on the other a somewhat chaotic search for freer religious life -- a movement towards Independency. The rapid spread of Presbyterianism increased rather than diminished the general religious commotion. It soon became clear that this was another form of ecclesiastical authority, as inflexible as the old, and lacking the sacred sanction of custom. Then, too, the Calvinistic theology of the time did violence to human nature as a whole. Its linked logic might compel intellectual assent, but there is something in a man as real as his intellect, which is not satisfied with this clamping of eternal truth into inflexible propositions. Personal soul-hunger, and the necessity which many individuals feel for spiritual quest, must always be reckoned with. It should not be forgotten that George Fox came to his spiritual crisis under this theology.

 Thus while theology was stiffening into fixed form with one group, it was becoming ever more fluid among great masses of people throughout the nation. Religious authority ceased to count as it had in the past. Existing religious conditions were no longer accepted as final. There was a widespread restlessness which gradually produced a host of curious sects. Fox came directly in contact with at least four of the leading sectarian movements of the time and there can be no question that they exerted an influence upon him both positively and negatively. The first "sect" in importance, and the first to touch the life of George Fox, was the Baptist -- at that time often called Anabaptist. His uncle Pickering was a member of this sect, and, though George seems to have been rather afraid of the Baptists, he must have learned something from them. They already had a long history, reaching back on the continent to the time of Luther, and their entire career had been marked by persecution and suffering. They were "Independents," i. e., they believed that Church and State should be separate, and that each local church should have its own independent life. They stoutly objected to infant baptism, maintaining that no act could have a religious value unless it were an act of will and of faith. Edwards, in his "Gangræna," 1646, reports a doctrine then afloat to the intent that "it is as lawful to baptize a cat, or a dog, or a chicken as to baptize an infant." Their views on ministry were novel and must surely have interested Fox. They encouraged a lay ministry, and they actually had cobblers, leather-sellers, tailors, weavers and at least one brewer, preaching in their meetings. John Bunyan, who was of them, proved to general satisfaction that "Oxford and Cambridge were not necessary to fit men to preach." Still stranger, they had what their enemies scornfully called "She-preachers." Edwards has recorded this dreadful error in his list of one hundred and ninety-nine "distinct errors, heresies and blasphemies": "Some say that 'tis lawful for women to preach, that they have gifts as well as men; and some of them do actually preach, having great resort to them"!

 Furthermore, they held that all tithes and all set stipends were unlawful. They maintained that preachers should work with their own hands and not "go in black clothes." This sad error appears in Edwards's chaotic list: "It is said that all settled certain maintenance for ministers of the gospel is unlawful." Finally many of the Baptists opposed the use of "steeple houses" and held the view that no person is fitted to preach or prophesy unless the Spirit moves him.

 The "Seekers" are occasionally mentioned in the Journal and were widely scattered throughout England during the Commonwealth. They were serious-minded people who saw nowhere in the world any adequate embodiment of religion. They held that there was no true Church, and that there had been none since the days of the apostles. They did not celebrate any sacraments, for they held that there was nobody in the world who possessed an anointing clearly, certainly and infallibly enough to perform such rites. They had no "heads" to their assemblies, for they had none among them who had "the power or the gift to go before one another in the way of eminency or authority." William Penn says that they met together "not in their own wills" and "waited together in silence, and as anything arose in one of their minds that they thought favored with a divine spring, so they sometimes spoke."

 We are able to pick out a few of their characteristic "errors" from Edwards's list in the "Gangræna." "That to read the Scriptures to a mixed congregation is dangerous." "That we did look for great matters from One crucified in Jerusalem 1600 years ago, but that does no good; it must be a Christ formed in us." "That men ought to preach and exercise their gifts without study and premeditation and not to think what they are to say till they speak, because it shall be given them in that hour and the Spirit shall teach them." "That there is no need of human learning or reading of authors for preachers, but all books and learning must go down. It comes from want of the Spirit that men write such great volumes."

 The "Seekers" expected that the light was soon to break, the days of apostasy would end and the Spirit would make new revelations. In the light of this expectation a peculiar significance attaches to the frequent assertion of Fox that he and his followers were living in the same Spirit which gave forth the Scriptures, and received direct commands as did the apostles. "I told him," says Fox of a "priest," "that to receive and go with a message, and to have a word from the Lord, as the prophets and apostles had and did, and as I had done," was quite another thing from ordinary experience. A much more chaotic "sect" was that of the "Ranters." There was probably a small seed of truth in their doctrines, but under the excitement of religious enthusiasm they went to wild and perilous extremes, and in some cases even fell over the edge of sanity. They started with the belief that God is in everything, that every man is a manifestation of God, and they ended with the conclusion which their bad logic gave them that therefore what the man does God does. They were above all authority and actually said: "Have not we the Spirit, and why may not we write scriptures as well as Paul?" They believed the Scriptures "not because such and such writ it," but because they could affirm "God saith so in me." What Christ did was for them only a temporal figure, and nothing external was of consequence, since they had God Himself in them. As the law had been fulfilled they held that they were free from all law, and might without sin do what they were prompted to do. Richard Baxter says that "the horrid villainies of the sect did speedily extinguish it." Judge Hotham told Fox in 1651 that "if God had not raised up the principle of Light and Life which he (Fox) preached, the nation had been overrun with Ranterism." Many of the Ranters became Friends, some of them becoming substantial persons in the new Society, though there were for a time some serious Ranter influences at work within the Society, and a strenuous opposition was made to the establishment of discipline, order and system. The uprising of the "Fifth-monarchy men" is the only other movement which calls for special allusion. They were literal interpreters of Scripture, and had discovered grounds for believing in the near approach of the millennium. By some system of calculation they had concluded that the last of the four world monarchies -- the Assyrian, Persian, Greek and Roman -- was tottering toward its fall, and the Fifth universal monarchy -- Christ's -- was about to be set up. The saints were to reign. The new monarchy was so slow in coming that they thought they might hasten it with carnal weapons. Perhaps a miracle would be granted if they acted on their faith. The miracle did not come, but the uprising brought serious trouble to Fox, who had before told these visionaries in beautifully plain language that "Christ has come and has dashed to pieces the four monarchies."

 The person of genius discovers in the great mass of things about him just that which is vital and essential. He seizes the eternal in the temporal, and all that he borrows, he fuses with creative power into a new whole. This creative power belonged to George Fox. There was hardly a single truth in the Quaker message which had not been held by some one of the many sects of the time. He saw the spiritual and eternal element which was almost lost in the chaos of half truths and errors. In his message these scattered truths and ideas were fused into a new whole and received new life from his living central idea.


 It is a strange fact that, though England had been facing religious problems of a most complex sort since the oncoming of the Reformation, it had produced no religious genius. No one had appeared who saw truth on a new level, or who possessed a personality and a personal message which compelled the attention of the nation. There had been long years of ingenious, patchwork compromise, but no distinct prophet. George Fox is the first real prophet of the English Reformation, for he saw what was involved in this great religious movement.[1] Perhaps the most convincing proof of this is not the remarkable immediate results of his labors, though these are significant enough, but rather the easily-verified fact that the progress of religious truth during the last hundred years has been toward the truth which he made central in his message.[2] However his age misunderstood him, he would to-day find a goodly fellowship of believers.

 The purpose of this book is to have him tell his own story, which in the main he knows how to do. It will, however, be of some service to the reader to develop in advance the principle of which he was the exponent. The first period of his life is occupied with a most painful quest for something which would satisfy his heart. His celebrated contemporary, Bunyan, possessed much greater power of describing inward states and experiences, but one is led to believe on comparing the two autobiographical passages that the sufferings of Fox, in his years of spiritual desolation, were even more severe than were those of Bunyan, though it is to be noted that the former does not suffer from the awful sense of personal sin as the latter does. "When I came to eleven years of age, I knew pureness and righteousness," is Fox's report of his own early deliverance from the sense of sin. His "despair," from which he could find no comfort, was caused by the extreme sensitiveness of his soul. The discovery that the world, and even the Church, was full of wickedness and sin crushed him. "I looked upon the great professors of the city [London, 1643], and I saw all was dark and under the chain of darkness." This settled upon him with a weight, deep almost as death. Nothing in the whole world seemed to him so real as the world's wickedness. "I could have wished," he cries out, "I had never been born, or that I had been born blind that I might never have seen wickedness or vanity; and deaf that I might never have heard vain and wicked words, or the Lord's name blasphemed."

 He was overwhelmed, however, not merely because he discovered that the world was wicked, but much more because he discovered that priests were "empty hollow casks," and that religion, as far as he could discover any in England, was weak and ineffective, with no dynamic message which moved with the living power of God behind it. He could find theology enough and theories enough, but he missed everywhere the direct evidence that men about him had found God. Religion seemed to him to be reduced to a system of clever substitutes for God, while his own soul could not rest until it found the Life itself.

 The turning point of his life is the discovery -- through what he beautifully calls an "opening" -- that Christ is not merely an historic person who once came to the world and then forever withdrew, but that He is the continuous Divine Presence, God manifested humanly, and that this Christ can "speak to his condition."

 At first sight, there appears to be nothing epoch-making in these simple words. But it soon develops that what he really means is that he has discovered within the deeps of his own personality a meeting place of the human spirit with the Divine Spirit. He had never had any doubts about the historical Christ. All that the Christians of his time believed about Christ, he, too, believed. His long search had not been to find out something about Christ, but to find Him. The Christ of the theological systems was too remote and unreal to be dynamic for him. Assent to all the propositions about Him left one still in the power of sin. He emerges from the struggle with an absolute certainty in his own mind that he has discovered a way by which his soul has immediate dealings with the living God. The larger truth involved in his experience soon becomes plain to him, namely, that he has found a universal principle, that the Spirit of God reaches every man. He finds this divine-human relation taught everywhere in Scripture, but he challenges everybody to find the primary evidence of it in his own consciousness. He points out that every hunger of the heart, every dissatisfaction with self, every act of self-condemnation, every sense of shortcoming shows that the soul is not unvisited by the Divine Spirit. To want God at all implies some acquaintance with Him. The ability to appreciate the right, to discriminate light from darkness, the possibility of being anything more than a creature of sense, living for the moment, means that our personal life is in contact at some point with the Infinite Life, and that all things are possible to him who believes and obeys.

 To all sorts and conditions of men, Fox continually makes appeal to "that of God" within them. At other times he calls it indiscriminately the "Light," or the "Seed," or the "Principle" of God within the man. Frequently it is the "Christ within." In every instance he means that the Divine Being operates directly upon the human life, and the new birth, the real spiritual life, begins when the individual becomes aware of Him and sets himself to obey Him. He may have been living along with no more explicit consciousness of a Divine presence than the bubble has of the ocean on which it rests and out of which it came; but even so, God is as near him as is the beating of his own heart, and only needs to be found and obeyed.

 Instead of making him undervalue the historic revelations of God, the discovery of this principle of truth gave him a new insight into the revelations of the past and the supreme manifestations of the Divine Life and Love. He could interpret his own inward experience in the light of the gathered revelation of the ages. His contemporaries used to say that, though the Bible were lost, it might be found in the mouth of George Fox, and there is not a line in the Journal to indicate that he undervalued either the Holy Scriptures or the historic work of Christ for human salvation. Entirely the contrary. As soon as he realized that the same God who spoke directly to men in earlier ages still speaks directly, and that to be a man means to have a "seed of God" within, he saw that there were no limits to the possibilities of a human life. It becomes possible to live entirely in the power of the Spirit and to have one's life made a free and victorious spiritual life. So to live is to be a "man" -- for sin and disobedience reduce a man. The normal person, then, is the one who has discovered the infinite Divine resources, and is turning them into the actual stuff of a human life. That it happens now and then is no mystery; that it happens so seldom is the real mystery. "I asked them if they were living in the power of the Spirit that gave forth the Scriptures" is his frequent and somewhat naïve question, as though everybody ought to be doing it.

 The consciousness of the presence of God is the characteristic thing in George Fox's religious life. His own life is in immediate contact with the Divine Life. It is this conviction which unifies and gives direction to all his activities. God has found him and he has found God. It is this experience which puts him among the mystics.

 But here we must not overlook the distinction in types of mysticism. There is a great group of mystics who have painfully striven to find God by a path of negation. They believe that everything finite is a shadow, an illusion -- nothing real. To find God, then, every vestige of the finite must be given up. The infinite can be reached only by wiping out all marks of the finite. The Absolute can be attained only when every "thing" and every "thought" have been reduced to zero. But the difficulty is that this kind of an Absolute becomes absolutely unknowable. From the nature of the case He could not be found, for to have any consciousness of Him at all would be to have a finite and illusory thought.

 George Fox belongs rather among the positive mystics, who seek to realize the presence of God in this finite human life. That He transcends all finite experiences they fully realize, but the reality of any finite experience lies just in this fact, that the living God is in it and expresses some divine purpose through it, so that a man may, as George Fox's friend, Isaac Penington says, "become an organ of the life and power of God," and "propagate God's life in the world." The mystic of this type may feel the light break within him and know that God is there, or he may equally well discover Him as he performs some clear, plain duty which lies across his path. His whole mystical insight is in his discovery that God is near, and not beyond the reach of the ladders which He has given us.

 But no one has found the true George Fox when he stops with an analysis of the views which he held. Almost more remarkable than the truth which he proclaimed was the fervor, the enthusiasm, the glowing passion of the man. He was of the genuine apostolic type. He had come through years of despair over the wickedness of the world, but as soon as the Light really broke, and he knew that he had a message for the world in its sin and ignorance, there was after that nothing but the grave itself which could keep him quiet. He preached in cathedrals, on hay stacks, on cliffs of rock, from hill tops, under apple trees and elm trees, in barns and in city squares, while he sent epistles from every prison in which he was shut up. Wherever he could find men who had souls to save he told them of the Life and Truth which he had found.

 Whether one is in sympathy with Fox's mystical view of life or not, it is impossible not to be impressed with the practical way in which he wrought out his faith. After all, the view that God and man are not isolated was not new; the really new thing was the appearance of a man who genuinely practiced the Divine presence and lived as though he knew that his life was in a Divine environment.

 We have dwelt upon the fundamental religious principle of Fox at some length, because his great work as a social reformer and as the organizer of a new system of Church government proceeds from this root principle. One central idea moves through all he did. His originality lies, however, not so much in the discovery, or the rediscovery, of the principle as in the fearless application of it. Other men had believed in Divine guidance; other Christians had proclaimed the impenetration of God in the lives of men. But George Fox had the courage to carry his conviction to its logical conclusions. He knew that there were difficulties entailed in calling men everywhere to trust the Light and to follow the Voice, but he believed that there were more serious difficulties to be faced by those who put some external authority in the place of the soul's own sight. He was ready for the consequences and he proceeded to carry out both in the social and in the religious life of his time the experiment of obeying the Light within. It is this courageous fidelity to his insight that made him a social reformer and a religious organizer. He belongs, in this respect, in the same list with St. Francis of Assisi. They both attempted the difficult task of bringing religion from heaven to earth.

 1. In the light of his religious discovery Fox reinterpreted man as a member of society. If man has direct intercourse with God he is to be treated with noble respect. He met the doctrine of the divine right of kings with the conviction of the divine right of man. Every man is to be treated as a man. He was a leveler, but he leveled up, not down. Every man was to be read in terms of his possibilities -- if not of royal descent, certainly of royal destiny. This view made Fox an unparalleled optimist. He believed that a mighty transformation would come as soon as men were made aware of this divine relationship which he had discovered. They would go to living as he had done, in the power of this conviction.

 He began at once to put in practice his principle of equality -- i. e., equality of privilege. He cut straight through the elaborate web of social custom which hid man's true nature from himself. Human life had become sicklied o'er with a cast of sham, until man had half forgotten to act as man. Fox rejected for himself every social custom which seemed to him to be hollow and to belittle man himself. The honor which belonged to God he would give to no man, and the honor which belonged to any man he gave to every man. This was the reason for his "thee" and "thou." The plural form had been introduced to give distinction. He would not use it. The Lord Protector and the humble cotter were addressed alike. He had an eye for the person of great gifts and he never wished to reduce men to indistinguishable atoms of society, but he was resolved to guard the jewel of personality in every individual -- man or woman.

 2. His estimate of the worth of man made him a reformer. In society as he found it men were often treated more as things than as persons. For petty offenses they were hung,[3] and if they escaped this fate they were put into prisons where no touch of man's humanity was in evidence. In the never-ending wars the common people were hardly more than human dice. Their worth as men was well nigh forgotten. Trade was conducted on a system of sliding prices -- high for this man, low for some other. Dealers were honest where they had to be; dishonest where thy could be. The courts of justice were extremely uncertain and irregular, as the pages of this journal continually show. Against every such crooked system which failed to recognize the divine right of man George Fox set himself. He himself had large opportunities of observing the courts of justice and the inhuman pens which by courtesy were called jails. But he became a reformer, not to secure his own rights or to get a better jail to lie in, but to establish the principle of human rights for all men. He went calmly to work to carry an out-and-out honesty into all trade relations, to establish a fixed price for goods of every sort, to make principles of business square with principles of religion. By voice or by epistle he called every judge in the realm to "mind that of God" within him. He refused ever to take an oath, because he was resolved to make a plain man's "yea" weigh as heavy as an oath. He was always in the lists against the barbarity of the penal system, the iniquity of enslaving men, the wickedness of war, the wastefulness of fashion and the evils of drunkenness, and by argument and deed he undertook to lead the way to a new heroism, better than the heroism of battlefields.

 3. The logic of his principle compelled him to value education. If all men are to count as men, it is a man's primal duty to be all he can be. To be a poor organ of God when one was meant for a good one belongs among the high sins.[4] If it was "opened" to him that Oxford and Cambridge could not make men ministers, his own reason taught him that it is not safe to call all men to obey the voice and follow the light without broad-basing them at the same time in the established facts of history and nature. Fox himself very early set up schools for boys and girls alike in which "everything civil and useful in creation" was to be taught. It is, however, quite possible that he undervalued the aesthetic side of man, and that he suffered by his attempt to starve it. In this particular he shared the puritan tendency, and had not learned how to hold all things in proportion, and to make the culture of the senses at the same time beautify the inner man.

 4. On the distinctive religious side his discovery of a direct divine-human relationship led to a new interpretation of worship and ministry. God is not far off. He needs no vicar, no person of any sort between Himself and the worshipper. Grace no more needs a special channel than the dew does. There is no special holy place, as though God were more there than here. He does not come from somewhere else. He is Spirit, needs only a responsive soul, an open heart, to be found. Worship properly begins when the soul discovers Him and enjoys His presence -- in the simplest words it is the soul's appreciation of God. With his usual optimism, he believed that all men and women were capable of this stupendous attainment. He threw away all crutches at the start and called upon everybody to walk in the Spirit, to live in the Light. His house of worship was bare of everything but seats. It had no shrine, for the shekinah was to be in the hearts of those who worshipped. It had no altar, for God needed no appeasing, seeing that He Himself had made the sacrifice for sin. It had no baptismal font, for baptism was in his belief nothing short of immersion into the life of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit -- a going down into the significance of Christ's death and a coming up in newness of life with Him. There was no communion table, because he believed that the true communion consisted in partaking directly of the soul's spiritual bread -- the living Christ. There were no confessionals, for in the silence, with the noise and din of the outer life hushed, the soul was to unveil itself to its Maker and let His light lay bare its true condition. There was no organ or choir, for each forgiven soul was to give praise in the glad notes that were natural to it. No censer was swung, for he believed God wanted only the fragrance of sincere and prayerful spirits. There was no priestly mitre, because each member of the true Church was to be a priest unto God. No official robes were in evidence, because the entire business of life, in meeting and outside, was to be the putting on of the white garments of a saintly life. From beginning to end worship was the immediate appreciation of God, and the appropriate activity of the whole being in response to Him.

 William Penn says of him: "The most awful, living, reverent frame I ever felt or beheld was his in prayer." And this was because he realized that he was in the presence of God when he prayed. He believed that the ministry of truth is limited to no class of men and to no sex. As fast and as far as any man discovers God it becomes his business to make Him known to others. His ability to do this effectively is a gift from God, and makes him a minister. The only thing the Church does is to recognize the gift. This idea carried with it perfect freedom of utterance to all who felt a call to speak, a principle which has worked out better than the reader would guess, though it has been often sorely tested.

 In the Society which he founded there was no distinction of clergy and laity. He undertook the difficult task of organizing a Christian body in which the priesthood of believers should be an actual fact, and in which the ordinary religious exercises of the Church should be under the directing and controlling power of the Holy Spirit manifesting itself through the congregation.

 Not the least service of Fox to his age was the important part which he took in breaking down the intolerable doctrine of predestination, which hung like an incubus over men's lives. It threw a gloom upon every person who found himself forced by his logic to believe it, and its effect upon sensitive souls was simply dreadful. Fox met this doctrine with argument, but he met it also with something better than argument -- he set over against it two facts: that Divine grace and light are free, and that an inward certainty of God's favor and acceptance is possible for every believer. Wherever Quakerism went this inward assurance went with it. The shadow of dread uncertainty gave place to sunlight and joy. This was the beginning of a spiritual emancipation which is still growing, and peaceful faces and fragrant lives are the result.

 No reader of the Journal can fail to be impressed with the fact that George Fox believed himself to be an instrument for the manifestation of miraculous power. Diseases were cured through him; he foretold coming events; he often penetrated states and conditions of mind and heart; he occasionally had a sense of what was happening in distant parts, and he himself underwent on at least three occasions striking bodily changes, so that he seemed, for days at a time, like one dead, and was in one of these times incapable of being bled. These passages need trouble no one, nor need their truthfulness be questioned. He possessed an unusual psychical nature, delicately organized, capable of experiences of a novel sort, but such as are today very familiar to the student of psychical phenomena. The marvel is that with such a mental organization he was so sane and practical, and so steadily kept his balance throughout a life which furnished numerous chances for shipwreck.

 It is very noticeable -- rather more so in the complete Journal than in this Autobiography -- that "judgments" came upon almost everybody who was a malicious opposer of him or his work. "God cut him off soon after," is a not infrequent phrase. It is manifestly impossible to investigate these cases now, and to verify the facts, but the well-tested honesty of the early Friends leaves little ground for doubting that the facts were substantially as they are reported. Fox's own inference that all these persons had misfortune as a direct "judgment" for having harmed him and hindered his cause will naturally seem to us a too hasty conclusion. It is not at all strange that in this eventful period many persons who had dealings with him should have suffered swift changes of fortune, and of course he failed to note how many there were who did not receive judgment in this direct manner. One regrets, of course, that this kindly spiritual man should have come so near enjoying what seemed to him a divine vengeance upon his enemies, but we must remember that he believed in his soul that his work was God's work, and hence to frustrate it was serious business.

 He founded a Society, as he called it, which he evidently hoped, and probably believed, would sometime become universal.[5] The organization in every aspect recognized the fundamentally spiritual nature of man. Every individual was to be a vital, organic part of the whole; free, but possessed of a freedom which had always to be exercised with a view to the interests and edification of the whole. It was modelled exactly on the conception of Paul's universal Church of many members, made a unity not from without, but by the living presence of the One Spirit. All this work of organization was effected while Fox himself was in the saddle, carrying his message to town after town, interrupted by long absences in jail and dungeon, and steadily opposed by the fanatical antinomian elements which had flocked to his standard. It is not the least mark of his genius that in the face of an almost unparalleled persecution he left his fifty thousand followers in Great Britain and Ireland formed into a working and growing body, with equally well-organized meetings in Holland, New England, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and the Carolinas. His personality and his message had won men from every station of life, and if the rank and file were from the humbler walks, there were also men and women of scholarship and fame. Robert Barclay, from the schools of Paris, gave the new faith its permanent expression in his Apology. William Penn worked its principles out in a holy experiment in a Christian Commonwealth, and Isaac Penington, in his brief essays, set forth in rich and varied phrase the mystical truth which was at the heart of the doctrine.

 This is the place for exposition, not for criticism. It requires no searchlight to reveal in this man the limitations and imperfections which his age and his own personal peculiarities fixed upon him. He saw in part and he prophesied in part. But, like his great contemporary, Cromwell, he had a brave sincerity, a soul absolutely loyal to the highest he saw. The testimony of the Scarborough jailer is as true as it is unstudied -- "as stiff as a tree and as pure as a bell." It is fitting that this study of him should close with the words of the man who knew him best -- William Penn: "I write my knowledge and not report, and my witness is true, having been with him for weeks and months together on diverse occasions, and those of the nearest and most exercising nature, by sea and land, in this country and in foreign countries; and I can say I never saw him out of his place, or not a match for every service or occasion. For in all things he acquitted himself like a man, yea, a strong man, a new and heavenly-minded man; a divine and a naturalist, and all of God Almighty's making."[6]

 [1] "But of 'prophets' there are very few. The good God does not seem to need many. Centuries pass, as He orders history, in which there are none. So we call them Dark Ages. Then comes some John in the desert, and the world is wakened, some Wesley in the Church of England, and there is a revival of religion.

 "For our English races, since there were English races, I count three or four such prophets; for the world of Europe I count perhaps eleven worthy of our gratitude to-day. I mean the gratitude of all mankind. Saint Paul and Saint John are two; Augustine of Hippo is three; Dante and Francis of Assisi are two more; Thomas à Kempis and Jacob Böhme, two more; and, coming across to England, Wiclif, John Milton, George Fox, and John Wesley." -- Edward Everett Hale, in an Address at the Wesley Bicentennial Celebration in People's Temple, Boston.

 "The three most influential Englishmen of the last three centuries were George Fox, John Wesley and John Henry Newman. Those who wish really to understand those three centuries must read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest Fox's Journal, Wesley's Journal, and Newman's Apologia. The entire future of England and the English Empire depends upon the answer to this question: Will Newman defeat Fox and Wesley, or will Fox and Wesley defeat Newman?" -- Editorial in "The Methodist Times."

 [2] "The Quaker religion which he (George Fox) founded is something which it is impossible to overpraise. In a day of shams, it was a religion of veracity rooted in spiritual inwardness, and a return to something more like the original gospel truth than men had ever known in England. So far as our Christian sects to-day are evolving into liberality, they are simply reverting in essence to the position which Fox and the early Quakers so long ago assumed. No one can pretend for a moment that in point of spiritual sagacity and capacity, Fox's mind was unsound. Every one who confronted him personally, from Oliver Cromwell down to county magistrates and jailers, seems to have acknowledged his superior power." -- James's "Varieties of Religious Experience," page 6.

 1. Direct students to read the background information on Jonathan Edwards and the Great Awakening found at "Religion in 18th-Century America," linked from the EDSITEment-reviewed American Memory Project. Excerpts are available on page 3 of the Text Document that accompanies this lesson.
 2. Provide students with the excerpt from Edwards' sermon, "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God," provided on pages 4-5 of the Text Document. (The full text of the sermon can be found at Yale University's Jonathan Edwards Center, accessible via the EDSITEment-reviewed resource History Matters. Note that this reading should be taught with care, as it is likely to contain material that will run contrary to some students' beliefs. Have one student read the excerpt aloud and explain as the sermon is read that the class should keep in mind the following questions:
    1. In what context (at what time and in what place) did Edwards deliver this sermon?
    2. Who would have represented Edwards' "ideal" audience?
    3. What message does Edwards convey in this passage?
    4. What reactions do Edwards' carefully crafted images attempt to evoke?
    5. Did Edwards employ vocabulary with which are you unfamiliar? If so, use a dictionary to look up any unfamiliar terms.
 3. Allow time for the students to work individually or in groups to complete the chart on pages 4-5 of the Text Document. This chart will ask them to identify the images that Edwards used in the sermon and what they were meant to signify. As they complete the chart, encourage the students to reflect upon the questions discussed as a class in the previous step.
 4. Place the students into two-person groups to compare and contrast their charts from the previous step and, using their answers as a starting point, formulate a generalization about the meaning and significance of Edwards' sermon.
*** Activity 2. George Whitefield
 The second activity will introduce students to George Whitefield, another leading preacher of the Great Awakening. Students will learn about how colonial Americans reacted to the preaching of the Great Awakening. Students will analyze a diary account of a colonial farmer who described hearing the news of Whitefield's approach to his Connecticut town.

 1. Instruct students to read: "The Great Awakening Comes to Weathersfield, Connecticut: Nathan Cole's Spiritual Travels" (from the EDSITEment-reviewed resource History Matters), a primary document about a Connecticut farmer's encounter with George Whitefield.
 2. Provide students with background regarding George Whitefield using the materials from the "Background Information for the Teacher" section and from the web resource "Religion in 18th Century America" (this excerpt has been included on page 3 of the Text Document) linked from the EDSITEment-reviewed web resource, American Memory.
 3. Direct the students to respond to the following questions (available in worksheet form on page 6 of the Text Document):
    1. Why do you think average farmers such as Nathaniel Cole stopped what they were doing and traveled great distances to witness George Whitefield speak?
    2. What message does Cole's statement, "I saw that my righteousness would not save me; then I was convinced of the doctrine of Election and went right to quarrelling with God about it, because all that I could do would not save me" reveal about Whitefield's teachings?
    3. After reading this passage, what conclusion can you draw about the religious practices and beliefs of the Great Awakening?
*** Activity 3. Samsom Occom, Indian Minister
 This activity will have students examine Sansom Occom's short autobiography, in which he describes his difficulties in making a living, his experiences as an Indian minister, and his poor treatment at the hands of the religious establishment. Occom (sometimes spelled Occum) is one of the most historically significant Native Americans who converted during the Great Awakening. In 1740, at the age of sixteen, he met Eleazar Wheelock, an enthusiastic Congregational preacher and a notable missionary to Native Americans. At the age of twenty, Occom went to live with Wheelock. After four years under Wheelock's tutelage, Occom departed to start his own work as a Christian missionary to Indians in New England and on Long Island. Occom was officially ordained a Presbyterian minister in 1759 on Long Island. In 1769, with funds partially raised by Occom, Wheelock founded Dartmouth College. The founding charter of Dartmouth declared one of the college's purposes to be "the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land ... and also of English Youth and any others."

 1. Read aloud the preface to Samsom Occom's autobiography "I believe It Is Because I Am a Poor Indian"
 2. Direct the students to categorize Samsom Occom's autobiography according to "Major Events," "Religious Practices or Influences," and "Occom's Personal Reflections." Have students complete the worksheet located on page 8 of the Text Document to help them better comprehend the three time periods outlined in his autobiography:
    1. From my Birth till I received the Christian Religion
    2. From the Time of our Reformation till I left Mr. Wheelocks
    3. From the Time I left Mr. Wheelock till I went to Europe
 3. Instruct the students to complete the worksheet on pages 9-10 of the Text Document. Distribute the chart. Read question #1 aloud and ask the students to write it on their charts. Give the students three to five minutes to write written responses. Then give the students three to five minutes to share their responses with their partners. Discuss the answers as a class. Repeat the same strategy using questions 2, 3, and 4.
    1. What questions would you ask Occom in order to better understand his personal and professional experiences?
    2. What information would enhance your understanding of Occom's religious practices compared to those of other ministers during the Great Awakening?
    3. Do you agree with Occom's conclusion that his status as a "poor Indian" detracted from his ability to influence the Indian population as well as his religious superiors? Use evidence from the text to support your argument.
    4. In many ways Occom is an extraordinary figure, since no more than a small fraction of Native Americans converted to Christianity. Why do you think this was the case?

**** Author	Sarah Grimke; Angelina Grimke; Theodore Weld
 Date	December, 1969
 Type	Primary Sources: Letter

 /When Sarah and Angelina Grimke--southern-born converts to the cause of antislavery--began writing and speaking on woman's rights as well as abolition, many of their fellow abolitionists objected. In these letters, the abolitionist organizer Theodore Weld explained his doubts about the wisdom of their activities, and Angelina responded. Like most abolitionists, Weld and the Grimk's addressed each other as 'sister' and 'brother,' a sign of the close ties between members of the anti-slavery movement/. 

 /The Grimkes' speaking out on woman's rights not only angered most clergy and most other conservative men, but also worried many abolitionists. They were concerned that the sisters were generating controversy which detracted from their effectiveness as agents for the antislavery cause. Even Theodore Weld, who himself believed in woman's equality and who was to marry Angelina Grimke in 1838, urged the sisters to confine themselves to abolitionism. He believed that the Grimkes, as Southerners and former slaveholders, were especially persuasive opponents of slavery. He told them that "this peculiar advantage you lose the moment you take another subject." But Angelina and Sarah were not convinced, even by Theodore Weld. Angelina wrote back that "the time to assert a right is the time when that right is denied." She attempted to convince him that "we cannot push Abolitionism forward with all our might until we take up the stumbling block out of the road." This correspondence ended with a compromise. Sarah continued publishing her Letters on the Equality of the Sexes but the sisters no longer emphasized the "woman question" in their public speeches. But this did not stop the attacks on them, because the simple fact of their speaking in public was just as controversial as what they said/.
**** Excerpts from the letters of Theodore Weld and Angelina Grimke

 Theodore Weld to Sarah and Angelina Grimke 
 New York, August 15 1837 

 My dear sisters 

 I had it in my heart to make a suggestion to you in my last letter about your course touching the "rights of women", but it was crowded out by other matters perhaps of less importance...

 Now as I have a small sheet (fool that I didn't take a larger) and much to say, I'll make points. 1. As to the rights and wrongs of women, it is an old theme with me. It was the first subject I ever discussed. In a little debating society when a boy, I took the ground that sex neither qualified nor disqualified for the discharge of any functions mental, moral or spiritual; that there is no reason why woman should not make laws, administer justice, sit in the chair of state, plead at the bar or in the pulpit, if she has the qualifications, just as much as tho she belonged to the other sex. Further, that the proposition of marriage may with just the same propriety be made by the woman as the man, and that the existing usage on that subject, pronouncing it alone the province of the man, and indelicacy and almost, if not quite immoral for woman to make the first advances, overlooks or rather perverts the sacred design of the institution and debases it...Now as I have never found man, woman or child who agreed with me in the "ultraism" of woman's rights, I take it for granted even you will cry out "oh shocking"!! at the courting part of the doctrine. Very well, let that pass. What I advocated in boyhood I advocate now, that woman in EVERY particular shares equally with man rights and responsibilities. Now I have made this statement of my creed on this point to show you that we fully agree in principle except that I probably go much farther than you do in a single particular. Now notwithstanding this, I do most deeply regret that you have begun a series of articles in the Papers on the rights of woman. Why, my dear sisters, the best possible advocacy which you can make is just what you are making day by day. Thousands hear you every week who have all their lives held that woman must not speak in public. Such a practical refutation of the dogma as your speaking furnishes has already converted multitudes...Besides you are Southerners, have been slaveholders; your dearest friends are all in the sin and shame and peril. All these things give you great access to northern mind, great sway over it...You can do more at convincing the north than twenty northern females, tho' they could speak as well as you. Now this peculiar advantage you lose the moment you take another subject. You come down from your vantage ground. Any women of your powers will produce as much effect as you on the north in advocating the rights of free women (I mean in contradistinction to slave women)...Now you two are the ONLY FEMALES in the free states who combine all these facilities for anti-slavery effort: 1. Are southerners. 2. Have been slaveholders. 3. For a long time most widely known by the eminence of friends. 4. Speaking and writing power and practice. 5. Ultra Abolitionist. 6. Acquaintance with the whole subject, argumentative, historical, legal and biblical. Now what unspeakable responsibilities rest on you -- on YOU! Oh my soul! that you but felt them as they are. Now can't you leave the lesser work to others...and devote, consecrate your whole bodies, souls and spirits to the greater work which you can do far better and to far better purpose than any body else...Let us all first wake up the nation to lift millions of slaves of both sexes from the dust, and turn them into MEN and then when we all have our hand in, it will be an easy matter to take millions of females from their knees and set them on their feet, or in other words transform them from babies into women ...I pray our dear Lord to give you wisdom and grace and help and bless you forever. 

 Your brother T. D. Weld
**** Angelina Grimke to Theodore Weld and John Greenleaf Whittier
 Brookline Mass. 8th Mo 20 - 1837 

 To Theodore D. Weld and J. G. Whittier 
 Brethren beloved in the Lord. 

 As your letters came to hand at the same time and both are devoted mainly to the same subject we have concluded to answer them on one sheet and jointly. You seem greatly alarmed at the idea of our advocating the rights of woman ...These letters have not been the means of arousing the public attention to the subject of Womans rights, it was the Pastoral Letter which did the mischief. The ministers seemed panic struck at once and commenced a most violent attack upon us... This Letter then roused the attention of the whole country to enquire what right we had to open our mouths for the dumb; the people were continually told "it is a shame for a woman to speak in the churches." Paul suffered not a woman to teach but commanded her to be in silence. The pulpit is too sacred a place for woman's foot etc. Now my dear brothers this invasion of our rights was just such an attack upon us, as that made upon Abolitionists generally when they were told a few years ago that they had no right to discuss the subject of Slavery. Did you take no notice of this assertion? Why no! With one heart and one voice you said, We will settle this right before we go one step further. The time to assert a right is the time when that right is denied. We must establish this right for if we do not, it will be impossible for us to go on with the work of Emancipation ...

 And can you not see that women could do, and would do a hundred times more for the slave if she were not fettered? Why! we are gravely told that we are out of our sphere even when we circulate petitions; out of our "appropriate sphere" when we speak to women only; and out of them when we sing in the churches. Silence is our province, submission our duty. If then we "give no reason for the hope that is in us", that we have equal rights with our brethren, how can we expect to be permitted much longer to exercise those rights? ...If we are to do any good in the Anti Slavery cause, our right to labor in it must be firmly established...O that you were here that we might have a good long, long talk over matters and things, then I could explain myself far better. And I think we could convince you that we cannot push Abolitionism forward with all our might until we take up the stumbling block out of the road...How can we expect to be able to hold meetings much longer when people are so diligently taught to despise us for thus stepping out of the "sphere of woman!" Look at this instance: after we had left Groton the Abolition minister there, at Lyceum meeting poured out his sarcasm and ridicule upon our heads and among other things said, he would as soon be caught robbing a hen roost as encouraging a woman to lecture. Now brethren if the leaders of the people thus speak of our labors, how long will we be allowed to prosecute them?...They utterly deny our right to interfere with this or any other moral reform except in the particular way they choose to make out for us to walk in...If we surrender the right to speak to the public this year, we must surrender the right to petition next year and the right to write the year after and so on. What then can woman do for the slave when she is herself under the feet of man and shamed into silence? ... 

 With regard to brother Welds ultraism on the subject of marriage, he is quite mistaken if he fancies he has got far ahead of us in the human rights reform. We do not think his doctrine at all shocking: it is altogether right ...By the bye it will be very important to establish this right, for the men of Mass. stoutly declare that women who hold such sentiments of equality can never expect to be courted. They seem to hold out this as a kind of threat to deter us from asserting our rights...

 Anti Slavery men are trying very hard to separate what God hath joined together. I fully believe that so far from keeping different moral reformations entirely distinct that no such attempt can ever be successful...They blend with each other like the colors of the rain bow...As there were prophetesses as well as prophets, so there ought to be now female as well as male ministers. Just let this one principle be established and what will become of the power and sacredness of the pastoral office? Is brother Weld frightened at my ultraism? Please write to us soon and let us know what you think after reflecting on this letter... 

 May the Lord bless you my dear brothers... 

 A. E. G. 

 [P.S.] We never mention women's rights in our lectures except so far as is necessary to urge them to meet their responsibilities. We speak of their responsibilities and leave them to infer their rights. I could cross this letter all over but must not encroach on your time. 

 I should not be at all surprised if the public demanded of us "by what authority doest thou this thing", and if we had to lecture on this subject specifically and call upon the men "to show cause if any they had" why women should not open their mouths for the dumb.

*** Parable One The Two Artists

 #+BEGIN_VERSE
 What is the difference between requiring love of the
 neighbor and finding lovableness
 in the neighbor?
 #+END_VERSE

 ... Suppose there were two artists, and the one said, "I have travelled much and seen much in the world, but I have sought in vain to find a man worth painting.I have found no face with such perfection of beauty that I could make up my mind to paint it.In every face I have seen one or another little fault.Therefore I seek in vain." Would this indicate that this artist was a great artist?On the other hand, the second one said, "Well, I do not pretend to be a real artist; neither have I travelled in foreign lands.But remaining in the little circle of men who are closest to me, I have not found a face so insignificant or so full of faults that I still could not discern in it a more beautiful side and discover something glorious.Therefore I am happy in the art I practice.It satisfies me without my making any claim to being an artist." Would this not indicate that precisely this one was the artist, one who by bringing a certain something with him found then and there what the much-travelled artist did not find anywhere in the world, perhaps because he did not bring a certain something with him!Consequently the second of the two was the artist.Would it not be sad, too, if what is intended to beautify life could only be a curse upon it, so that art, instead of making life beautiful for us, only fastidiously discovers that not one of us is beautiful.Would it not be sadder still, and still more confusing, if love also should be only a curse because its demand could only make it evident that none of us is worth loving, instead of love's being recognized precisely by its loving enough to be able to find some lovableness in all of us, consequently loving enough to be able to love all of us.

*** Parable Two The King and the Maiden


 #+BEGIN_VERSE
 To what shall we compare
 the divine love that overcomes the Infinite distance
 between human sin and the holiness of God?
 #+END_VERSE

 Suppose there was a king who loved a humble maiden." But the reader has perhaps already lost his patience, seeing that our beginning sounds like a fairy tale, and is not in the least systematic.So the very learned Polos found it tiresome that Socrates always talked about meat and drink and doctors, and similar unworthy trifles, which Polos deemed beneath him (Gorgias)." But did not the Socratic manner of speech have at least one advantage, in that he himself and all others were from childhood equipped with the necessary prerequisites for understanding it?And would it not be desirable if I could confine the terms of my argument to meat and drink, and did not need to bring in kings, whose thoughts are not always like those of other men, if they are indeed kingly.But perhaps I may be pardoned the extravagance, seeing that I am only a poet, proceeding now to unfold the carpet of my discourse (recalling the beautiful saying of Themistocles)," lest its workmanship be concealed by the compactness of its folding.

 Suppose then a king who loved a humble maiden.The heart of the king was not polluted by the wisdom that is loudly enough proclaimed; he knew nothing of the difficulties that the understanding discovers in order to ensnare the heart, which keep the poets so busy, and make their magic formulas necessary.It was easy to realize his purpose.Every statesman feared his wrath and dared not breathe a word of displeasure; every foreign state trembled before his power, and dared not omit sending ambassadors with congratulations for the nuptials; no courtier grovelling in the dust dared wound him, lest his own head be crushed.Then let the harp be tuned, let the songs of the poets begin to sound, and let all be festive while love celebrates its triumph.For love is exultant when it unites equals, but it is triumphant when it makes that which was unequal equal in love.Then there awoke in the heart of the king an anxious thought; who but a king who thinks kingly thoughts would have dreamed of it!He spoke to no one about his anxiety; for if he had, each courtier would doubtless have said: "Your majesty is about to confer a favor upon the maiden, for which she can never be sufficiently grateful her whole life long." This speech would have moved the king to wrath, so that he would have commanded the execution of the courtier for high treason against the beloved, and thus he would in still another way have found his grief increased.So he wrestled with his troubled thoughts alone.Would she be happy in the life at his side?Would she be able to summon confidence enough never to remember what the king wished only to forget, that he was king and she had been a humble maiden?For if this memory were to waken in her soul, and like a favored lover sometimes steal her thoughts away from the king, luring her reflections into the seclusion of a secret grief; or if this memory sometimes passed through her soul like the shadow of death over the grave: where would then be the glory of their love?Then she would have been happier had she remained in her obscurity, loved by an equal, content in her humble cottage; but confident in her love, and cheerful early and late.What a rich abundance of grief is here laid bare, like ripened grain bent under the weight of its fruitfulness, merely awaiting the time of the harvest, when the thought of the king will thresh out all its seed of sorrow!For even if the maiden would be content to become as nothing, this could not satisfy the king, precisely because he loved her, and because it was harder for him to be her benefactor than to lose her.And suppose she could not even understand him?For while we are thus speaking foolishly of human relationships, we may suppose a difference of mind between them such as to render an understanding impossible.What a depth of grief slumbers not in this unhappy love, who dares to rouse it! ...

 Moved by love, the God is thus eternally resolved to reveal himself.But as love is the motive so love must also be the end; for it would be a contradiction for the God to have a motive and an end which did not correspond.His love is a love of the learner, and his aim is to win him.For it is only in love that the unequal can be made equal, and it is only in equality or unity that an understanding can be effected....

 But this love is through and through unhappy, for how great is the difference between them!It may seem a small matter for the God to make himself understood, but this is not so easy of accomplishment if he is to refrain from annihilating the unlikeness that exists between them.

 Let us not jump too quickly to a conclusion at this point. ... Much is heard in the world about unhappy love, and we all know what this means: the lovers are prevented from realizing their union, the causes being many and various.There exists another kind of unhappy love, the theme of our present discourse, for which there is no perfect earthly parallel, though by dint of speaking foolishly a little while we may make shift to conceive it through an earthly figure.The unhappiness of this love does not come from the inability of the lovers to realize their union, but from their inability to understand one another.This grief is infinitely more profound than that of which men commonly speak, since it strikes at the very heart of love, and wounds for an eternity; not like that other misfortune which touches only the temporal and the external, and which for the magnanimous is as a sort of rest over the inability of the lovers to realize their union here in time.This infinitely deeper grief is essentially the prerogative of the superior, since only he likewise understands the misunderstanding....

 Our problem is now before us, and we invite the poet, unless he is already engaged elsewhere, or belongs to the number of those who must be driven out from the house of mourning, together with the flute-players and the other noise-makers, before gladness can enter in.The poet's task will be to find a solution, some point of union, where love's understanding may be realized in truth, the God's anxiety be set at rest, his sorrow banished.For the divine love is that unfathomable love which cannot rest content with that which the beloved might in his folly prize as happiness.
**** A

 The union might be brought about by an elevation of the learner.The God would then take him up unto himself, transfigure him, fill his cup with millennial joys (for a thousand years are as one day in his sight), and let the learner forget the misunderstanding in tumultuous joy.Alas, the learner might perhaps be greatly inclined to prize such happiness as this.How wonderful suddenly to find his fortune made, like the humble maiden, because the eye of the God happened to rest upon him!And how wonderful also to be his helper in taking all this in vain, deceived by his own heart!Even the noble king could perceive the difficulty of such a method, for he was not without insight into the human heart, and understood that the maiden was at bottom deceived; and no one is so terribly deceived as he who does not himself suspect it, but is as if enchanted by a change in the outward habiliments of his existence.

 The union might be brought about by the God's showing himself to the learner and receiving his worship, causing him to forget himself over the divine apparition.Thus the king might have shown himself to the humble maiden in all the pomp of his power, causing the sun of his presence to rise over her cottage, shedding a glory over the scene, and making her forget herself in worshipful admiration.Alas, and this might have satisfied the maiden, but it could not satisfy the king, who desired not his own glorification but hers.It was this that made his grief so hard to bear, his grief that she could not understand him; but it would have been still harder for him to deceive her.And merely to give his love for her an imperfect expression was in his eyes a deception, even though no one understood him and reproaches sought to mortify his soul.

 Not in this manner then can their love be made happy, except perhaps in appearance, namely the learner's and the maiden's, but not the Teacher's and the king's, whom no delusion can satisfy....
**** B

 The union must therefore be brought about in some other way.Let us here again recall Socrates, for what was the Socratic ignorance if not an expression for his love of the learner, and for his sense of equality with him? . . . In the Socratic conception the teacher's love would be merely that of a deceiver if he permitted the disciple to rest in the belief that he really owed him anything, instead of fulfilling the function of the teacher to help the learner become sufficient to himself.But when the God becomes a Teacher, his love cannot be merely seconding and assisting, but is creative, giving a new being to the learner, or as we have called him, the man born anew; by which designation we signify the transition from nonbeing to being.The truth then is that the learner owes the Teacher everything.But this is what makes it so difficult to effect an understanding: that the learner becomes as nothing and yet is not destroyed; that he comes to owe everything to the Teacher and yet retains his confidence. . . .

 Since we found that the union could not be brought about by an elevation it must be attempted by a descent.Let the learner be x. In this x we must include the lowliest; for if even Socrates refused to establish a false fellowship with the clever, how can we suppose that the God would make a distinction!In order that the union may be brought about, the God must therefore become the equal of such an one, and so he will appear in the likeness of the humblest.But the humblest is one who must serve others, and the God will therefore appear in the form of a servant.But this servant-form is no mere outer garment, like the king's beggar-cloak, which therefore flutters loosely about him and betrays the king;" it is not like the filmy summer-cloak of Socrates, which though woven of nothing yet both conceals and reveals." It is his true form and figure.For this is the unfathomable nature of love, that it desires equality with the beloved,not in jest merely, but in earnest and truth.And it is the omnipotence of the love which is so resolved that it is able to accomplish its purpose, which neither Socrates nor the king could do, whence their assumed figures constituted after all a kind of deceit....

 But the servant-form was no mere outer garment, and therefore the God must suffer all things, endure all things, make experience of all things.He must suffer hunger in the desert, he must thirst in the time of his agony, he must be forsaken in death," absolutely like the humblest-behold the man! . . ."

 Every other form of revelation would be a deception in the eyes of love; for either the learner would first have to be changed, and the fact concealed from him that this was necessary (but love does not alter the beloved, it alters itself); or there would be permitted to prevail a frivolous ignorance of the fact that the entire relationship was a delusion. . . .

 Now if someone were to say: "This poem of yours is the most wretched piece of plagiarism ever perpetrated, for it is neither more nor less than what every child knows," I suppose I must blush with shame to hear myself called a liar.But why the most wretched?Every poet who steals, steals from some other poet, and in so far as we are all equally wretched; indeed, my own theft is perhaps less harmful since it is more readily discovered.

Emperor Daigo has been seeking to overcome his figurehead status, and he succeeds temporarily because he is joined by a number of warriors who are at odds with the family of the shogunate ruling from Kamakura – the Hōjō family. These warriors supporting the emperor are interested in redistributing feudal privileges and enlarging their land holdings. Emperor Daigo declares the end of the Hōjō shogunate, and the Hōjō shogun commits suicide. This marks the end of the Kamakura era – an era that began in the year 1185.
- 1336  Emperor Daigo has rewarded his warrior supporters with less than they had expected. Ashikaga Takauji leads the military men in turning against the emperor. They capture the imperial city, Kyoto, and establish an amenable emperor from the northern faction of the royal family – the royal family having divided into factions, with Daigo from the southern faction. Ashikaga Takauji names himself the new shogun. The Ashikaga family is now to dominate the shogunate and to rule Japan from Kyoto.  The Ashikaga family is to be superior in wealth but unable to dominate the whole of Japan without alliances – a source of future trouble.

Believing that the end of the world is at hand, some groups engage in frenzied bacchanals and orgies. Those called Flagellants believe that the plague is the judgment of God on sinful mankind. Walking across countryside, men and women flog one another. They preach that anyone doing this for thirty-three days will be cleansed of all sin – one day for every year that Christ lived. The Church is on guard against creative, heretical theology and Pope Clement VI condemns the movement.

- 1370  The warrior Timur, at the age of thirty-four, has become the dominant power in Transoxiana. His army is modeled after the armies of Genghis Khan, but with more foot soldiers and his warriors were more from settled families than they were nomadic horsemen. It is an army whose loyalty is to its commander rather than to a nation, an army that finds glory in Timur's reputation as a great warrior. Timur has new walls built on the foundation of those destroyed by the Mongols – walls surrounded by a deep moat. He has the market place improved, and it will be said that he has great gardens created and palaces built. Samarkand's magnificence and prosperity will be said to have caused envy in Cairo and Baghdad.

They are to excommunicate each other. France, Scotland and Spain will support the claims of Pope Clement. England, the Holy Roman Empire and most of Italy will support Urban VI.  Some in the Church want both popes to resign and a new election.  
- 1380  Seeing himself as the new Genghis Khan and needing to conquer to live up to Genghis Khan's image, Timur has gone eastward, ravaging countryside and making the people around Issyk-kul his subjects.

- 1387  The leader of the rebellion against Mongol rule has liberated all of China. He considers himself has having the Mandate of Heaven. He takes the title Hong-wu, and he founds a new dynasty – the Ming.
- 1389  The Battle of Kosovo takes place, Turks against a force of Serbs with at least a few Albanians, under Prince Lazar Herebeljanovic, a battle with no clear victors that, like many other historical events, was to be mythologized.  
- 1391  Timur has been waging war to the west of Samarkand, conquering Persia, punishing and making an example of the inhabitants of that city for their resistance. Timur believes that with an enhanced reputation for terror people will be more tractable in their negotiations with him. His strategy is to frighten people into obedience, saving his army from having to fight. Those who do not submit or those who rebel, his army massacres. They massacre men, women and children, and they burn what they cannot carry away. While Timur is busy in Persia, a Mongol force comes south from the forest region around Moscow, and, from the Caucusus region, Timur pushes them back toward Moscow. Late in the year, Timur's army is heavily laden with goods and in need of rest and reinforcements, and Timur and his army return to Samarkand.
- 1397  In Florence the Medici bank is founded.
- 1398  During his stay in Samarkand, Timur hears news from India. With the excuse that Muslim rulers in India are too tolerant toward Hindus, Timur leads his army there. He destroys the Islamic kingdom centered at the city of Delhi, creating carnage and devastation. He is pleased that he has penetrated India more deeply than did Alexander the Great or Genghis Khan. He returns from India with Indian artists, craftsmen and booty, distributing goods to underlings who stayed behind but expect reward for their loyalty.

** 19th c. timeline
*** 1
- 1801  Britain is rising as an industrial power. The average life expectancy is around 40. A fictional "better-off" family will be described as drinking water that has a cow taste because it is taken from a brook from which cows drink. Meat is rare. Dental care is poor. The family eats with wooden spoons. Candles are rarely used because they cost too much. The father "visited the city once, but the travel cost him a week's wages...

This does not deter those in the US who want war, and Congress declares war against Britain on June 18, 1812.
- 1812  Napoleon's march into Russia exposes his recklessness and shallow strategic thinking. His march into Russia is not going well. His three top-ranking subordinates urged a halt to the campaign.

On September 7 at the Battle of Borodino he losses 30,000 to 35,000 more men, dead, wounded or captured. A week later he is in Moscow. In mid-October he begins a terrible march back from Russa, ending his campaign with none of the army of 600,000 with which he began.

* Highlights of text
** Highlights Ch. 18/19
*** Ch. 18
**** cont. existentialism
Christian faith cannot be separated from its starting point in Jesus Christ. Some of Bultmann’s “left-wing” followers, like the American Schubert Ogden, have concluded that Christianity concerns only the possibility of a new way of existing.
LOCATION: 5620

theologians have also appropriated insights from existentialism for Christian theology. Paul Tillich, who fled from Hitler to begin a new career in the United States, thought of theology as a dialogue.
LOCATION: 5627
**** RC
Canadian Bernard Lonergan and the German Karl Rahner stand as probably the two greatest recent exponents of such new Catholic theology. Lonergan had an odd relationship to twentieth-century thought.
LOCATION: 5642

Lonergan argued that our modern awareness of history makes us realize that we can never get “the truth” once and for all. He therefore proposed that good theology is not that which gets the “right answers” but that which follows the right method.
LOCATION: 5645

Good thinking, good asking of questions, involves being attentive to data, being intelligent about forming hypotheses on the basis of that data, being rational in testing those hypotheses, and being responsible about applying the results of our thought.
LOCATION: 5649

Rahner may be hard to understand in part due to his desire to talk about mystery, and that cannot be easy.
LOCATION: 5656

Rahner thought that mystery is, well, more mysterious than that, and also more pervasive. We often assume that many areas of our lives are free from mystery—mystery continues only in some awkward corners. Rahner said that there is a fundamental mystery, a matter of religious faith, at the heart of all human understanding.
LOCATION: 5658

Rahner insisted therefore that religion is implicitly at work far more widely than we usually suppose.
LOCATION: 5664

were developing a new style of Catholic theology. They talked less about eternal truths and more about a process of inquiry, a search for truth.
LOCATION: 5671
**** Important
They were moving away from a theology that *emphasized contrasting opposites (nature/grace, earth/heaven, the world/the church)* to a theology that talked about evolutionary growth—nature moving toward grace, the world moving toward the kingdom of God.
LOCATION: 5673
**** Vat. 2
Vatican II tended to define “the church” not as the hierarchy of pope and bishops but as the whole “pielgrim people of God.”
LOCATION: 5678

Karl Barth’s Epistle to the Romans marked the theological division of the nineteenth century from the twentieth, even though it was not published until 1919. In describing this theology he later compared it to a man in an unlit church who wandered by himself up a staircase.
LOCATION: 5697

The theological world was as shocked by Epistle to the Romans as he was. It challenged any cozy alignment of church with culture, spoke of the “night” into which Christian theology had fallen, and charted a new course for theology in the twentieth century.
LOCATION: 5701
*** Ch. 19
**** HOPE AND ESCHATOLOGY
LOCATION: 5729

In Germany a number of theologians rebelled against Bultmann and his followers.
LOCATION: 5730

Criticizing him for virtually eliminating the Old Testament as a resource for Christian theology they argued that an alliance with existentialism tends to put too much emphasis on the individual and not enough on social change.
LOCATION: 5730

biblical scholarship has rediscovered the importance of eschatology and the kingdom of God in Jesus’ preaching, theologians like the Protestant Jürgen Moltmann and the Catholic Johannes Metz used eschatology as the basis for a theology that would be more open to the new and the unexpected and also more concerned about changing the world, working for reform in society.
LOCATION: 5732
NOTE: N.B. &quot;eschatology&quot; as a term

Wolfhart Pannenberg, has also drawn on the renewed interest in eschatology, but Pannenberg has concerned himself more with intellectual clarity than with social change. He has attacked Barth, and many others, for retreating into a theological ghetto in which Christians talked to each other without trying to defend their point of view in the wider intellectual community.
LOCATION: 5737

Language has also been a preoccupation for French philosophers like Jacques Derrida and François Lyotard, and theologians have recently used their ideas to develop a “postmodern” theology.

Two world wars, the Holocaust, and increasing globalization make such “modern” views impossible to hold in a postmodern world. Derrida advocated the need for a postmodern “deconstruction” of knowledge.

Liberation theology first drew wide attention in the United States in connection with “black liberation.”
LOCATION: 5819

King’s reply drew from many sources—the call for justice in the Old Testament prophets, Aquinas’s argument that an unjust law may not be a law at all, Reinhold Niebuhr’s analysis of the injustice of institutions, arguments for civil disobedience from Socrates to Thoreau and Gandhi, and his own experience as a black American:

James Cone’s Black Theology and Black Power, published in 1969, made the blacks’ liberation from their white oppressors its central theological theme and addressed whites with warnings rather than pleas for help.

They opposed elements in the Christian tradition that discriminated against women—from interpretations of Genesis 2 that “blamed” Eve for the fall to approaches to Christian ethics that taught women to be subservient and obedient to men.

This review of various strands of liberation theology has indicated an agenda of problems more than describing solutions or even discussing the most important theologians at length.
LOCATION: 5882

Looking beyond that, Rosemary Radford Ruether (a prolific theologian committed both to feminism and to Christianity) has written, All theologies of liberation, whether done in a black or a feminist or a Third World perspective, will be abortive of the liberation they seek, unless they finally go beyond the … model of the oppressor and the oppressed.

To complicate the problem, Shinto or Hinduism or Buddhism or Islam is not “just a religion” (if such a phrase really means anything). It shapes the whole society, from family relationships to rules of etiquette to attitudes toward government.

Other theologians of pluralism have been less insistent that multiple religions are different ways of saying the same thing. A Roman Catholic priest named Raimundo Pannikar, for example, born in Spain to a Hindu father and a Spanish mother, advocates a more strictly comparative approach.

*** HEGELIANS AND ANTI-HEGELIANS
Nineteenth-century philosophers worried about the relation of history to claims of absolute truth in a more general way. It seems that each society, each era, sees the world differently, and those who compare these worldviews inevitably see them from the perspective of their own society. Is there any way to judge among them?Read more at location 5148   

Hegel wanted to take history more seriously, to allow for more basic change in the way we experience things, and he also argued that, if we cannot know or talk about things-in-themselves,Read more at location 5161   

That is all the reality we know. Therefore, all reality has a three-stage form: (1) There is a thinking subject; but (2) in order to think, that subject has to have an object to think about; but (3) that object is part of the experience of the subject and therefore not really separate from it.Read more at location 5163

Most philosophers of the nineteenth century had, like Hegel, assumed that history was progressing. If we do not have the truth, at least we are closer to it than previous generations. Nietzsche said only that truth varies from one place to another, and there can be no standard for judging one version to be superior to another. Indeed, “truth” is simply whatever a society agrees to call “true”—the socially accepted lie.Read more at location 5380

** Readings ch. 14
*** 
I was surprised to learn that some of the views that Calvin expressed line up with some views of my own. For example, "we cannot understand ourselves if we ignore God, and we cannot understand God without facing up to the truth about ourselves" and "The order of the universe proclaims the glory of God, but we fail to see it. We deny God, then, finding our lives falling apart, we invent something to put in God's place...our sin prevents us from seeing the world alright" (188). I couldn't agree more with the fact that we ignore or run from God when we feel as if we've messed up or sinned. We don't even feel worthy of the grace that we've freely been given. We sometimes even get to a point where we don't want anything to do with God at all and, like the book mentions, we try to put something else in His place -- something else that won't satisfy the hole or emptiness we feel within ourselves. 
*** 
I have a question about Quakers and Puritans. I wonder why the Quakers were in such opposition of the church? I read that George Fox, one of the greatest leaders even refused to call the church a church.
*** 
"Starting with the chapter God's Governance from the text, I must say you can tell the chapter was mostly about how the church and state were interwoven during the Middle Ages. With Calvin's principle of predestination and how the elected were of divine power, it is easy to see how the church and state were not separated. It's nothing new to see people looking to their representatives to understand their own religious beliefs but I think it's interesting how Geneva was Protestant surrounded by Catholic borders. Regardless, I think the most important point made from the reading was how God knows or determines who will accept grace and reject it, thus implying that free will is sort of not free will.

*** Trust in History, progress, rational.
The 19th c. began with a reaction against the perceived sterile rationalism of the
Enlightenment and a trust that History itself was moving forward, upward, and in a better
direction. Progress was inevitably being made through a kind of invisible Hegelian god­like
hand. What evidence do you see, for and against the progress of history?
*** "Genius"
The text notes that "A new spirit of nationalism created new interest in various national
traditions ­­ the brothers Grimm scoured the countryside for old folktales, composers
incorporated folk tunes in their symphonies." The previous chapter was titled "City on a Hill"
and seemed to focus on the particular "genius" of the American experiment. Discuss the
pros and cons of the "new spirit of nationalism" referenced in the 17th chapter.

/Christianity is radically not like society/

/Christianity is faith expressed through a society/

*** ch. 18
**** Learnings
- The chapter traces the changes that occurred in the church in Western industrialized countries like the U.S. It begins by talking bout Barth and his attempt to remove superiority and Christians link to one another. It also spoke of the secularized and moralistic changes with Christianity. 
- I saw a bit of resemblance to the previous chapter in the aspect of the Bible being interpreted literally or metaphorically. At the beginning of the chapter, when talking about how Liberal commentators started interpreting the Bible in terms that related to modern society, this is where I understood that Christianity was going to go through an evolutionary change. Barth's ideology played a resounding part in this chapter. He believed, for one, that people need to stop trying to understand God so much or "reach up to God like the tower of Babel," but people must rather "accept the fact that we can know of God only what God reveals." I noted through the text that a principle of modern Christian theology could in fact be a search for the truth. Although Barth discredits this process, I think it is one of the most important aspects of modern Christianity. Natural religion has definitely contributed to the search for the truth about God. Bultmann is another person whose influence on modern Christianity is rather influential int he chapter. His take on inauthentic and authentic existence is very much relatable to today's world. He believed that the process of one getting tied up with "average" day to day affairs is a sin, because you are denying living for Christ, or leading an authentic life. You will rather busy, or so as Bultmann would say, distract yourself with the small features of your day than live for a bigger purpose. If this is the case, than the whole world is guilty of this sin. However, Bultmann knows that it is nearly impossible to not lead an inauthentic lifestyle and suggests instead that we rely on God's everlasting love and forgiveness to cope with the fact that we cannot lead authentic lives. There is plenty of references to new ways of living as well. The left winged followers of the chapter went against Bultmann in believing that Christianity should be concerned with the possibility of a new way of living. The right winged Bultmannians agree that Jesus lies "inextricably at the foundations of the Christian faith." Some argued that Jesus's life is metaphoric and is not achievable, while others argued that Jesus's life is merely the starting point of Christianity and should be seen as the foundation of Christian life. From my church experience, I have never seen the Bible or Jesus' life interpreted metaphorically. I have always heard or been told that one should ascribe to be "Christ-like" and live as much like Christ as possible. This always bothered me because that is impossible, not nearly impossible, or almost impossible, but FLAT OUT impossible. Why ascribe to be something that you know you cannot reach when it is also taught that God loves you for who YOU are? Not for who you are in Jesus. . . Regardless of the fact, the end of the chapter posed an emphasis on the Catholic take on social reform. You can see a shift from Catholics only worrying of their own salvation and lives and to that of others. The chapter says this was attributed to the study of Thomas Aquinas. I believe the time period was perfect for the switch to wanting social reform because at the time child labor laws became prominent, sweatshops were shut down, racism and discrimination was being fought, and so on and so forth. It seems almost bandwagon-ish for the Catholic Church to suddenly turn it's attention to social reform. I see this as a way for the church to gain new followers and just transition into what seems popular at the time. 
- Rudolf Bultmann was a theologian that adopted his ideas from surrounding milieu; these ideas turned optimism to talk of boundary situations and crises and our responsibility as we face death alone. Theologians in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, and women and blacks in the U.S. also, moved theology away from the assumptions of traditional European culture. When this century was beginning, Ernest Troeltsch argued that Christianity would endure as long as Western culture, which wasn’t as encouraging a thought any longer, therefore Christian theology was looking for new ways to define its own identity.  As Karl Barth was emerging and studied the Bible more, he found a “strange new world” there, “something very ancient, early oriental, indefinably sunny, wild, and original.” Barth rejected all of the 19th century efforts to show the cultural superiority of Christianity and honed theology down to the claim that through this very ambiguous, imperfect Christian faith God chooses to be revealed. Karl Barth thought that replacing 19th century liberalism with existentialism didn’t deal with or fix the actual problem, it only attempted to find human words adequate to God’s Word, which there are none adequate. Nazi ideology owed more to neopaganism that to Christianity, and the most committed Nazis always intended to follow the murder of the Jews with the destruction of Christianity. Human beings cannot reach God, but God has come to human beings, and Barth increasingly found that this fact led him to find positive things about humanity. Barth’s determination to not letting modern culture shape Christian faith led many liberal readers to feel that he simply repeated biblical language, but he kept the conservatives off guard also with his attacks on “religion” and profound reinterpretations of the traditional doctrines. Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a part of a church that was in opposition to Hitler, but Bonhoeffer remained in Germany. Because of this, the Nazis arrested him but while in his jail cell Bonhoeffer continued to write theology in the form of letters. Bonhoeffer thought that “religion” has come to mean an individualism that turns away from the world to worry about one’s own salvation. He also believed that God wasn’t supposed to be at the boundary of our lives, He should be the center of our lives. Bonhoeffer was also looking for ways to preach Christ to people in a world where all of the old assumptions at the foundation of religion no longer seemed to make sense. Charles Hodge and Benjamin B. Warfield had defined orthodoxy as based on the infallibility of the Bible. Though Hodge rejected much of modern sciences conclusions, he accepts its way of thinking.  He acknowledged that the inspiration of the biblical writers extended only to teaching what God wanted them to teach us. Rauschenbusch said that Christians had come to pay too much attention to individual salvation and not enough to the call for social change Implied in the symbol of the kingdom of God. A young pastor by the name of Reinhold Niebuhr shared Rauschenbusch’s concern for social reform became active in liberal and socialist movements, but, both politically and theologically, the social gospel movement’s dream of steadily improving society until we achieve the kingdom of God seemed too simple to him. 
- I really liked the part on existentialism since it's something i've read about before and i like the ideas and questions it brings about. The book stated: "As Heidegger always emphasizes, we are all going to die, and that means we have finite time; in choosing to do some things, we pass up chance to do others -- and live with the consequences, knowing that we are responsible for them. Most people avoid facing up to this fact. They sink into 'everydayness,' 'averageness,' and 'idle chatter,' worrying about what to have for dinner, what to do this weekend, and never asking what they want to make of their lives" (257). If i could get all of that printed on a t-shirt, i would. I believe that thinking about your life and what you want to make of it is so important. I also fully believe that there is purpose in everything, big or small. But to find any sort of purpose for our lives, we have to break away from this "everydayness" and "averageness" that pretty much everyone gets stuck in. We have to do something different. For me, personally, i don't want to be average and sit back and do the same things the people before me or the people around me have done. That's safe and boring. It doesn't get you anywhere. I want to take risks, and be bold, and stand out, do something different and be different so that i can make an impact in the lives around me and hopefully, the world. I do this through acknowledging that death is inevitable, so i have to take the time i have on this earth and use it ever so wisely in order to not waste the life i have been given. I have to live and choose to live. And a main part of doing this is taking my faith along with me. Spreading the hope and love that Jesus brought to us is what i want to take around to other people. People who are longing for something more, something different. I want to show others that there is a way to get by in this messed up world, that redemption isn't far. And i can't do that if i sit around and be average, being consumed with the petty things of the world.
- Barth wanted Christianity to be as radical as possible to step away from the normality of 19th century Christianity. He believe that faith was beyond human understanding and that we can't prove that Jesus was better than any other religious leader. We can't understand God on our own or through other people's words. We can only understand through God himself. I agree partially because I think everyone needs their own personal revelation with God, but I also think their has to be so,e uniformity. I also think that you have to take what other people preach into consideration. It may not fit your ideology completely, but you can take truths out of many people's statements and find your own truth. Princeton's orthodoxy saw the Bible as literal truths, as in a collection of facts. I personally don't believe everything is literal in the Bible. I think their is concepts we can't personally fathom so they are written metaphorically, like poetry. I also believe in evolution to a certain extinct which Princeton's orthodoxy went against. Rauschenbusch believed we needed to step away from individual salvation and focus on society. We should focus more on taking Earth to a heavenly status. I like the fact that he wanted to put emphasis on society and making Earth better. I feel as if a person should think about their individual salvation but that shouldn't be the reason behind their good works. They should want to make things better regardless of where they go. Bultman believed in existentialism. He believed we don't need facts about Jesus, and we didn't need any proof. He believed if we needed proof to believe in God, then our faith is compromised. We can't have a personal commitment without faith. Humans decide what to make of their lives and don't have a universal nature. I love this ideology. Everyone has the opportunity to create their lives but many times people find excuses. I believe that God already knows everything that we are going to do, but he gives you multiple paths to take in life and he leaves free will for us to pick which path, in which he will help us down. I completely agree with the quote, "if God loves us even in our sin, we can risk living authentically." If God loves me regardless of my sins, I should be able to really live my life the way I want to and learning from my mistakes and sins I make along the way. Catholic theology moved more toward a search for truth instead of eternal truths. It focused on evolutionary growth of nature working towards grace, and the world moving toward the kingdom of God. 
- The Idea of Individual men is very interesting. like saying that we do act different because of society and because being a part of a group makes us act in ways to protect that group even thought if we are alone we would not do the same thing. and I think that is very interesting because we can understand a lot about how we ready the bible if we have this type of idea in mind. 
- During the early 20th century Barth thought that something was wrong with theological tradition. He believed that the grace of God in Christ was possible. Barth said that parts of the Bible reflected the author's bias and assumptions. He said Paul "knew something about God and managed to communicate it through biased, inadequate human words." Barth believed that pastors should "speak of God. We are human beings that, however, and so cannot speak of God." He impacted theology with his commentary on Romans. He attacked all "natural theology." He believed our effort to understand God and religion as the ultimate sin. He sees it as the Towel of Babel situation. This help to shed light on what I perceived this story as. Everybody in this world wanted to reach the ultimate goal of getting to heaven by building something physical to get there. Barth sees the urgency of people trying to get to God as a sin. I agree with him about only knowing what God reveals to us. He said that the knowledge of God begins with Jesus Christ. Barth had thoughts like Calvin who believed that there was imposing limits on God's grace. He disagreed with infant baptism. Bonhoeffer was in church opposition with Hitler. Bonhoeffer saw that "religion" came to the point of "individualism." Hodge and Warfield came up with an orthodoxy based on the Bible not having the ability to be wrong. Believed the Bible had literal truth in every statement. Hodge rejected the conclusion of modern science. Hodge came up with "mechanical theory of inspiration" in which biblical writers express themselves by their culture and do not take word for word dictation from God. The five fundamental points are bible inerrancy, the virgin birth, the satisfaction theory of the atonement, bodily resurrection, and the miracles of Jesus. Rauschenbusch said that Christians pay so much attention to self salvation and none toward changing their environment. Niebuhr agreed with Rauschenbusch and that no party or cause can be unambiguously good. Bultmann was a New Testament scholar and pioneered "form criticism."Studied the development of ideas in early church, NOT to learn about the history of Jesus' life. Existentialism is the movement of embracing Jews, Christians, and atheists. He believes you cannot understand humans like scientists do, because humans do not have a nature. 
- American Theologists criticized American culture.  Karl Barth was a Swiss pastor that wanted to separate the grace of God and Christian superiority.  Rudolf Bultmann used existentialism in his philosophy.  The Catholic church began to ask whether or not its philosophy held all of the absolute truths, especially concerning salvation.  Theology moved even further away from the traditional European and Catholic thought as a result of theology from Africa, Latin America, Asia, and women in blacks in the US.  Karl Barth studied the Bible and found it to be very radical and original; it made other theology seem dull.  Theologists tried to pick and choose parts of the Bible that went along with their culture or ideas.  Because we are human, the search for sufficient theology is inherently impossible.  However, Barth did not agree that existentialism solved many theological problems, it only tried to find the words to explain God but there aren't adequate words.  Barth did not agree with natural theology at all.  Barth was very bold against conforming the church to the Nazi party.  Barth argued that because Jesus was human, God authenticated the value in humanity. Barth criticized Calvin only for separating the elect because it limits God's grace.  However, Barth never confirmed a belief in universal salvation. Hodge rejected many conclusions of science but called the Bible a storehouse of facts.  Fundamentalism became increasingly popular, especially amongst Americans.  The social gospel movement was trailblazed by Rauschenbusch, who believed that Christians were not paying enough attention to society as a whole.  Nothing organized by humans is perfect and any institution is full of imperfections and impurities.  Bultmann was considered a New Testament scholar and was more concerned with how the early church developed and not as concerned with the histology of Jesus' life.  Existientialism  is the idea that humans do not have a true nature and we cannot understand humans in a scientific way. Bultmann related existentialism to Jesus  through the message of forgiveness and how people are freed through forgiveness.  The Catholic theologies became popular with Pope Leo XIII when debates about abortion, birth control, celibacy, etc began.  Lonergan argued that awareness does not come from correctness or the truth, because the truth will never be settled upon, but that it comes from following a particular method centered around good thinking and good questions.  Rainier brought up the idea of mystery and that mystery is extremely pervasive.  Some people began to believe that grace could work outside of the church realm.
- "In the 20th century, the biggest issue facing Christianity was the incorporation of contemporary culturei into Christian theology. In addition, Christianity started to entail a broader outlook where Western civilization was not the core focus. No longer was theology stuck in Europe or America. This allowed for the plurality of expressions of Christian theology that was once only Westernized. Germany, for example, developed German war theology to express the superiority of Christianity. Oppositions to the German War theology paid huge prices, some even with their lives and livelihood, during the rise of Nazism and the World Wars. Barth was a believer in the opposition. Christianity, to Barth, was far from perfect. The imperfection of Christianity is that  we only know God through what he reveals and our limited understanding. This seemed to me to hark on earlier notions of Realism and Nietzsche. Some believed that the Christian toleration of anti-Semitism propelled Nazism. I find that interesting because theology has progressed to the idea of theological liberalism in the 19th century, which emphasized ethics, yet it still rationalized anti-Semitism as contemporary culture. Still today the question remains, how does Christianity incorporate contemporary culture to allow progressivity without loosing core values and ethics? Barth answered how to rationalize the evil of his day, explaining it as impossible to rationalize evil since it exists and we should understand it as potent for knowing that God is unable to save everyone. The 20th century also was the era of Fundamentalism in America. Fundamentalism stood on principles of biblical inerrancy, virgin birth, Christ atoned for our sins, bodily resurrection, and miracles. Fundamentalism stood as a reaction to contemporary culture being more secular. This notion may seem antiquated today but it still important to the Church and society as a whole, since we still have debates whether prayer in schools is necessary.  The social gospel movement also came in this era,birthed from liberalism theology,  it focused on issues of the poor and working class to enact social reform and political changes to help the often undermined Christian believer. As exegetical criticism became popular in America, some theologians sought to revive earlier processes, such as Bultmann and Heideggarian existentialism. America showed a plurality in Christian theology during the 20th century. 
- One can also point to the improvement in Catholic theology moving away from the dichotomies in Christianity and focusing on growth within Christianity as a contemporary outlook Vatican II made the Church more inclusive of the community and  described  instances like the Cold War's arms race to mean a turn to economic concern instead of humanity. Overall, the 20th sought to improve society and Christianity. "
- In just reading the beginning of the chapter, where it mentions that theology had tried to identify Christianity, it made me try to figure out what non-Christians see Christians as. And depending on where you are from and with whom you have grown up with, I think that as a whole, Christians are seen as 1. goody-goody 2. hypocritical 3. in-your-face 4. "always looking for an argument" and 5. always right (I'm sure theres more). And I think it is this way because there has been a huge change in the U.S. in politics/gender change/feminism......and for us Christians we try to follow what the Bible says and because we are staying the same and not evolving with the world we become the "bad guy" because we believe in certain things that the world cannot accept because they do not want to stop doing wrong because they are so use to it so instead of them changing the world has to change to accept them. And today we "have" to accept them because feelings will get hurt.
- When I saw the chapter, 'The End of Western Christiendom" i was very itnterested. Barth and Bonhoeffer both had important theories and idea's behind religion. I espeically found the separation of christianity from culture and religion an interesting idea.
- With the war in Europe and the rise of the Nazi thinking, most theologians and the church were adapting to contemporary culture.  The Nazis were putting their beliefs into the church.  Christian theology was looking for a new way to separate themselves from the European way and was looking for a way to define its own identity.  Not all theologians agreed with the Nazis such as Barth and Bonhoeffer.  One was imprisoned and killed and the other fled to Switzerland because of their beliefs against the Nazis.  The World Wars had a great impact on how theologians started to interpret the Bible and the way they looked at the world and the reasons why society acted like it did.
- The western way of religion, or cultural religious beliefs ended and a new way of religion came about. a
**** Surprise
- The idea of Bultmann denying crucial things to the Christian faith such as Jesus being raised from the dead on the third day after his crusifixtion.
- Niebuhr insisted that humans ascribing for social reform will not make humans good. I found this rather bleak. This surprised me because there is no mention of redemption through man's want for social reform. This seemed like a Marxist statement. It also surprised me that the chapter seemed to blame Christians for the anti-Semitic movement. There were many other factors that contributed to this and not just Christianity. Maybe I am a little ignorant to the topic but I not believe Christian views on the Jews was the only contributing factor to the hate of the whole race. 
- Liberal commentators tried to sort out the parts of the Bible that reflected the author’s own biases or the assumption of his culture, with the hope of eliminating the residue of that earlier culture and restarting Christianity in terms of appropriate to our modern society. "Faith is . . . beyond all human ideas and affirmations . . ., beyond every positive religious achievement . . . It is always a leap into the darkness of the unknown, a flight into empty air." -Karl Barth. Every effort to show the ethical superiority of Christianity to other religions of theologies collapses in failure. Barth said that religion is the ultimate sin, the effort to reach up to God like the tower of Babel; we must accept that we can only know about God what God reveals. If the Christians before the 1930s had firmly denounced the anti-Semitism, then the Holocaust could have not happened. According to Barth, all Christians can say about evil is that Christ defeated it.
- When it was talking about the Nazis and anti-Semitism, this quote really stuck out: "If Christians in the generation before the 1930s had firmly denounced anti-Semitism, the Holocaust could not have happened. That fact must haunt Christian theology for the rest of history" (251). First, I found this claim to be fairly bold. I also didn't know that Christians had tolerated anti-Semitism and let sermons denouncing Jews (for example, calling them "Christ-killers") to happen. Thus, thinking more about this statement, it rings some truth. If there had not been such a hatred of Jews at this time, then would Hitler have been motivated to consider killing them? Would the idea even cross his mind? or would it still have happened anyway? I don't know. However, it's pretty disappointing that "Christians" allowed hate against a single group of people to occur and be preached about it, fueling an evil that changed the course of history forever.
- I knew that Nazis killed Jews, but I did not know they intended to murder Jews with the destruction of Christianity. I like how Heidegger describes the "inauthentic existence."
- I am not really surprised to read about what I read about the German Nazi's but I did learn things I did not previously know and that I was surprised I never learned before.  I did not know the Nazi's tried to use the church as propaganda and that after they killed the Jews planned to destroy Christianity.  I found the idea that if the previous generation to the 1930's had been more strongly against anti-Semitism that the Holocaust couldn't have happened very interesting.  
- "Ethical liberalism in the 19th century has progressed into a less humane theology like German War theology of the 20th century. 
- Also that the Catholic church had a contemporary shift, the same institution, that had been antiquated for quite some time. 
- It surprises me that Christianity is split up so, that now there are so many groups of "Christians" that cannot agree with each other which in turn give them their own identity, not so much in Christianity what in "Christianity" where what they believe is right. Christianity is so diverse.
- the influences and mentions of Nazi Genrmany interested me greatly, I find this time period very interesting. I dont understand how all of that happened without the world knowing so seeing it from this classes point of view was interesting.
- The fact that Heidegger emphasized how we all go into an everyday "averageness".  Because we don't alway think about making an impact on life but just with getting through life day by day.  And that we shouldn't live like that we shouldn't be afraid of failure or not achieving our goals because of the fear of the failure that might come with the attempt.
- It surprised me how a religion could change completely. 
**** Questions
- "Bonhoeffer tried to define the possibility of a religionless Christianity. I really really really would like to know what Christianity would be if it was religionless then? Is Christianity not a religion and if not, than what is it?
- On page 250 the book talks about Paul knowing something about God and that he managed to communicate it through biased inadequate human words. Does this mean that because God is in fact God, that Paul’s words are not able to fully describe God’s attributes and His power and Abilities? With the thought that Christians before the 1930s could have prevented the holocaust if they denounced the anti-Semitism ideologies, do you agree with this? I feel that Hitler would have still gone after the Jewish population because he wanted only the Aryan race to survive because they were mostly purebred German. How would you explain the connection between the three big theological thinkers in this time period?
- No questions
- Is extistentalism considered a form of Christianity?
- I really want to know what Rahner thought that the Catholic church was keeping in secret. like why would you say that most of their theology was secrets?
- Barth believed, "As ministers we ought to speak of God. We are human beings that, however, and so cannot speak of God" (pg. 250). This quote was just ultimately confusing. I do not know if he is contradicting himself or if there is an underline criteria that is spoken of, but is not clarified in the reading. 
- Barth said that religion is the ultimate sin because we try to reach up to God like the tower of Babel.  However, if someone wants to have a relationship with God, doesn't that require intimacy? Intimacy requires closeness and a passion for getting closer and closer to God.  As one falls more in love with God, one would want to know him more.  So why would it be a sin to try to reach God out of a passion for God?  When Barth talks about universal salvation, is he referring literally to everyone born? How would "anticommunism" be more dangerous to Christianity than communism?
- Should I understand that the movement towards exegitical criticism in the 20th century caused most theologians to hold traditional thoughts or were they progressive still? 
- If people who call themselves Christians, but don't follow the Bible, why do they continue to call themselves Christians? Is there a sense of authority to them? Why can't they have a different name instead of making Christians look bad? Whats is so powerful about the word Christian, to those who are "fake" who don't truly believe, that they want to change the meaning of it?
- I know we are moving further into the 20th century, but I am curious if all of the 19th century will be forgotton, as there is a shift in this century.
- So did the German church consider itself to be Christians or was it a Catholic church during World War 2 when Hitler and the Nazis were putting their beliefs and touches on the church.
- I had questions about the political christian world in the western countries.

- Some argued that Jesus’s life is metaphoric and is not achievable, while others argued that Jesus’s life is merely the starting point of Christianity and should be seen as the foundation of Christian life. From my church experience, I have never seen the Bible or Jesus’ life interpreted metaphorically. I have always heard or been told that one should ascribe to be “Christ-like” and live as much like Christ as possible. This always bothered me because that is impossible, not nearly impossible, or almost impossible, but FLAT OUT impossible. Why ascribe to be something that you know you cannot reach when it is also taught that God loves you for who YOU are? Not for who you are in Jesus. . . Regardless of the fact, the end of the chapter posed an emphasis on the Catholic take on social reform.

It seems almost bandwagon-ish for the Catholic Church to suddenly turn it’s attention to social reform. I see this as a way for the church to gain new followers and just transition into what seems popular at the time.

*** God-consciousness
   - what really is a pure God-Consciousness? Like i have a idea from reading the chapter but i can really completely understand it. because the way that he describe looks like that we can have it if we want. 
*** Hegel
   - Hegel described Christianity on the basis of thesis, antithesis and synthesis of God and creation. God exists and creates the world, therefore God and creation are not separate. This way of thinking already exists in Christianity in terms of the holy trinity. Hegel created a number of theologians and philosophers who sought to build upon his ideas. Strauss explained the Gospels as a collection of myths meant to carry meaning and traditional ideals not historically accurate statements. Feuerbach thought of God as man's projected reality and made it applicable to all truth claims. Marx explained religion as an illusory tool to support economic oppression. Kierkegaard the most contemporary of the Hegelians sought to interpret life through Christianity not just explain it. 
   - Did Hegel and Marx work together at one time in their careers?  I took a history class and can not recall if they had worked together and believed in the same thing in their beliefs with religion.
   - It surprised me that Hegel advocated that humans are a part of God. I look at him saying that God is within us, which implies the holy trinity, but I saw it as him saying since we can think about God, that that means we are apart of him. I'm not too sure about this. It is as if me saying since I can think about my couch I am now apart of the fabric that makes up that couch. Maybe I am not understanding it clearly. 
   - I think that the important Idea and one that really make me think about all that is going one everyday in life is the idea of "Absolute truth" because just like Hegel were working about how having so many different cultures and beliefs or in other words each society sees the world in a certain way, how can we know what is actually truth? and that is very strong connect with religion because we see things that the roman catholic church made believe that it was the truth. 
   - I enjoyed the part about Hegel reveal that there was three stages to reality. “(1) There is a thinking subject; but (2) in order to think, that subject has to have something to think about; but (3) that object is part of the experience of the subject and therefore not really separate from it”. I read this quote one time and I did not understand it until I read over it three to four times and read further. “In order to be God, God has to create the world, but that world is God’s creation and therefore not ultimately separate from God” (236). I just enjoyed the way that something can be so complex, yet so simple. 
*** Importance of History
   - In the 19th century there was a rise in awareness of history and people were becoming more open about emotion in relation to religion.  The revolutions happening in American and in France made people pay more attention to historical change.  Nationalism was becoming popular.  Friedrich Schleiermacher and Samuel Coleridge were romanticists defending Christianity from natural religion.  Hegel questioned absolute truths.  Schleiermacher wanted to keep up with the times and also keep up with his religion. He took the stance that Bible and Church are more about the role they play in the experience a Christian has.  He focused on experience a lot, and tried to make Christianity seem more personal.  He wanted to reinterpret original doctrine instead of rejecting it.  Coleridge acknowledged a difference between understanding and reason.  Both Schleiermacker and Coleridge defended Christianity's place in culture, but with arguments that rejected universal truths.  Hegel took history seriously.  The three stage forms of reality are a thinking subject, the object of thought, and that because the object is part of the experience of the subject they are not truly separate of each other.  Kierkegaard brought up the argument that faith would not be faith if it were reasonable and provable.  Nationalism and loyalty to the Cothic church created problems, especially during the French Revolution.  The Church of England became opposite the churches in Rome.  The Church adapted to society but could no longer criticize it.  As a result the Osford movement began to challenge English Christianity on whether or not it had conformed too much to society.  Ritschl kept Christianity and culture paired and wanted to move theology away from metaphysical thinking and make it more personal and direct to the lives of people.  
   - History is hard to collect especially when it deals with important events (which event is more important-it definitely differs in different countries as well).
   - Revolutions in America and France caused not only historical change but also religious change. They struggled with finding a universal truth for all these different views in Christianity. Schleiermacher believed that church was apart of the Christian experience but our feeling of absolute dependency from the moment we were born until death was also a absolute dependency on God. Jesus had absolute dependency on God also but wasn't distracted by social corruption like we are. Coleridge believed that religion was in the realm of reason. Hegelians believed that we can only have an understanding of God and ourselves through studying history. I agree with Hegel only with the exception that no one can know every aspect or perspective of history. I completely agree that out minds shape the reality around us. That is what makes it so hard to understand history because everyone doesn't think the same. Anti-hegelians believe that God is a projection of the human imagination. Oddly enough I believe this to a certain degree. I don't think God is made up, but I do believe people make certain things up about God and religion to run from the truth of what really is. Christianity and culture had a hard time coexisting. For example, Darwin's theory of evolution caused much controversy. I really don't understand why there is still such a separation between science and religion. I think both can clearly work together but people only pay attention to the extremes. I like the fact that Christianity was trying to move toward more contact with someone's life in Germany. I feel like everyone before focused on religion for when you die but no one focused on how religion affects the life you're living. However, they speak of Christianity being the absolute religion but what about the time in history before Christianity. I also think that you can determine if Jesus was right or wrong because history is all about perspective and just because one person saw it one way and wrote it down, doesn't mean it happened that way. And it also depends on if the person took it literally or metaphorically like so many romanticism poets of earlier. 
   - As Theology. I never thought of biblical encounters as history because I don't take all of the stories in the Bible literally. However, there are some encounters that I think happened. I like how this chapter addressed this. Kierkegaard sort of looked at it as if one can go off of faith or one can go off of history as being religious as well. I prefer Hegel's view which basically points to history as being rational. I think one having faith that everything in the Bible did happen is completely different than one believing it to be actual history, and in this thought is where I feel plenty of people struggle with their faith. If it is hard to believe what happened in the Bible to be history, then is that not doubting the absolute power of God or basically the pure existence? This part of the chapter made me question this entirely. Another important concept of the chapter, once again, is the dynamic of the church and state. It is always bought to question how much power the Pope should have over the church and whether or not the State/Government has the right to dictate things according to religious affairs. This is old news in my opinion, but something new to gain from the chapter's depiction of this power struggle is how the Oxford Movement "began to ask if English Christianity had not compromised too much with its society." I remember underlining this sentence and marking this as modern christianity. This is literally still prevalent in today's christianity. For example, Christians seem confused on how to deal with homosexuality, even since society seems to be adjusting now. Also back in that time slavery was an issue. Christians at that time advocated, some anyways, for slavery. You can see a blending between society and people's religious integrity.  
   - I did not understand what "Christianity was simply the religion of one culture" really meant. Is this inferring that Christianity is simply a product of one's experience around their environment?
   - History was starting to make an impact on theology.  People started to question religion all the time with what had happened to Christianity.  So the church was always having to have new answers for different events and why they happened.  Events such as the French Revolution had a huge impact on Europe and why it had happened and why change had happened.  This chapter went into people like Marx and how religion was only to keep control over people in society.  People were questioning the Bible and if the stories were false or made to be there to provide a moral lesson for example.  This chapter went into how government was being to separate from the church and how the Pope was losing his power throughout Europe because different societies believed in different things.
*** Romanticism
   - I've never truly understood Romanticism (and maybe I still don't), but their complete reliance and focus on emotions and feelings is actually disgusting. The Bible talks about how deceitful and sick the heart is, yet Romantics suggest relying on it more than reason. While science and logic shouldn't be everything, it's certainly of some importance and definitely more than the Romantics give it.
     - History was crucial to 19th century believers
     - Romantic theologians emphasized emotions feelings over arguments and evidence
     - denying Natural Religion seemed to limit Christianity to one culture; prevented it from applying to all cultures
     - Hegelians believed our experiences shape our perspectives more than history and facts do
     - Anti-Hegelians feel that God is not real, or at least not the focus. Humanity and society are the true subjects that deserve our attention.
     - Kierkegaard is the real MVP (in other words, the was an Anti-Hegelian, but he pointed back to Christ. He described faith as a paradox that cannot be proven and attempted to show those who grew up in the Christian tradition that they were not truly followers of Christ)
     - Roman Catholics in the 19th century seemed to criticize their society and were prejudiced against them while the Church of England was more tolerant (maybe too tolerant), according to Placher
     - Liberals sought to avoid any beliefs that ignored everyday society. Some questioned the true roots of Christianity or the meaning of the Kingdom of God, while others (like Nietzsche) claimed Christianity applauded the weak thereby making those who follow its practices weaker."
   - "This chapter displayed how the European Christian theology developed into a focus on emotion and intuition during the 19th century as a reaction to 18th century rationalism. 19th century theology was also influenced by the strong sense of nationalism coming from the Revolutions in France and America. As new nations were beginning to form and change society, so was Christian theology. Pious people like Schleiermacher attempted to define religion as transcendent and focus more on feelings rather than facts.Schleiermacher stated that we all have a connection to God called “God-consciousness” the makes us absolutely dependent on God but it is masked by everyday sinfulness but it is the believer's communication with Jesus (he has pure God-consciousness) that makes them a Christian.This made Christianity more accessible to non-intellectual lay people and more individualized. Schleiermacher and theologians like him tried to make sure that Christianity was perceived in a more general way and  proved a stark contrast to Lutheran ideology of scriptural impotance or 18th century reason.
   - Also, I was surprised by that most of the way that we think about Christianity and Christian thought is tied to the 19th century. For example, when I look at the different interpretations of the New Testament, Schweitzer's view of Jesus was under the influence of immediate apocalyptism in reference to the “kingdom of God” I understand why denominations today find the same to be true. "
   - I learned that overall there was a question about how each society sees the world differently and no one could make any claim to absolute truth and religion was used to test their theories. The two romantics in were Schleiermacher and Coleridge. In 1820s Schleiermacher wrote "The Christian Faith", so he could present more traditional Christian doctrines. He also believed that we all had "absolute dependence". He believed in the people being self-conscious. He also believed that social corruption was the real original sin. I kind of agree with that idea. Sin in a society kind of occurred when Adam conformed to what Eve had did. I also see how Coleridge influences the question of division between the state and the government. State taxes were used to support the church. From what I know, in today's society tithes are used. Hegel was known as one of the century's greatest philosophers. I quoted something I really like about him in my "This surprised me" box.
*** Schleiermacher
   - The way that Friedrich Schleiermacher interpreted scripture was really cool to read, along with his theology. He acknowledged that he can sense that he didn't create or shape himself and has a relation with the person who did -- God. This, to Scleiermacher, is a "feeling of absolute dependence," which is God-consciousness. And "that feeling lies within each of us, but we often lose sight of it. We get caught up in daily affairs and lose sight of that which underlies all our experience. Theologians...call this 'sin'" (235). I completely agree with what Schleiermacher is saying because it still rings true to today and his view of sin makes a lot of sense. I know that i get distracted constantly and so essentially, i lose sight of what is most important -- which is my faith. I try to make other things more important than God, which in turn become idols, for example, and so by then, i'm sinning. It's important to avoid this because once we lose our focus and turn our attention away from God, then life becomes messy and seems pretty pointless. But once we take away these distractions and put our focus on our Maker, then life makes sense again.
*** Kierkegaard
   - I was just surprised at how bold Søren Kierkegaard was. I've seen his name and looked into what he believes before, so it was cool to see him mentioned and learn more about his philosophy. Kierkegaard took an approach to basically call out people who called themselves "Christians", but who, to him, were not actually Christians. "'People who perhaps never once enter a church, never think about God, never mention His name except in oath...are all Christians, call themselves Christians.' Kierkegaard thought all these comfortable, middle-class people bore little resemblance to the apostles and martyrs" (240). Kierkegaard makes a great point here, which again, applies to today and Christianity as whole. Many people claim to be a "Christian," yet they don't seem to reflect what being one actually means, thus, causing confusion to non-Christians and believers alike. Jesus ultimately shows what it means to be a Christian, or a follower of him, by challenging us to love our neighbors (Mark 12:31) and enemies (Matt. 5:43-48), to help the poor or those who are in need (Matt. 25:35-40), to forgive others (Matt. 18:21-22), to not be judgmental of others (Luke 6:37), to pray (Matt. 6:5-13), and most importantly, to love God with all of our being -- heart, mind, soul (Mark 12:29-30). To truly be followers of Jesus and to actually make a difference in this world, we have to stand out by doing the things Jesus taught. And the way we live our life reflects, again, to non-believers and believers alike, whether our faith and Jesus is worth believing in or not.
*** Biblical interpretation
   - On page 238 I didn't realize that the Bible was questioned so much as it is today in how to interoperate the stories in the Bible and if they are real or not.  
*** Modernity
   - The statement "…distorting Christianity and for failing to face the full implications of modernity" surprised me because I feel like it reflects today's society.  With the rise in awareness and recognition of the homosexual community, some people have tried to distort Christianity and make it appear more or less modern.  I was surprised that people felt like historical facts and science had little to do with religion and did not matter.  I was surprised to read that Karl Marx was influenced by Hegelians and that Marx and Kierkegaard were influenced by the same philosophy, just in different ways.
   - The 19th century also made way for questioning the separation of church and state. Religious denominations such as the Anglicans and Catholic church in Europe made great strides to connect the two, a lot of times against the will of the people it served. Reforms and changes were adopted, which fluctuated the degree the state had control in the church, caused many to question the legitimacy of religious theology and religion's real motives in the believer's piety."
   - I was puzzled a little bit by the closing statement to the chapter on page 232, "For nations as for individuals, the awareness that we deserve the worst we get, and all else is grace, remains one of the hardest lessons of Christian theology". 
   - I had question about how the church and state began to intertwine. It shows that this has been a consistent problem. I just understand how a country will say that they are built on religion, but then not want religion with in the government. Coleridge categorize the church along with universities, armies, and postal service that is used to benefit the community. If a church is used to benefit the community why can't they also receive benefits?
   - "Nearing the end of the 19th century, the theological progress of Christianity that was once promised was nearing an end. But now reflecting on the historical context, I can see how the intensity of World Wars in the 20th century caused many to pause theological discussion.
** Responses to ch. 18
*** Summary
- William C. Placher, Chapter 18: The End of Western Christiandom	The chapter traces the changes that occurred in the church in Western industrialized countries like the U.S. It begins by talking bout Barth and his attempt to remove superiority and Christians link to one another. It also spoke of the secularized and moralistic changes with Christianity. 
- William Placher and Derek Nelson, Chapter 18: The End of Western Christendom	I saw a bit of resemblance to the previous chapter in the aspect of the Bible being interpreted literally or metaphorically. At the beginning of the chapter, when talking about how Liberal commentators started interpreting the Bible in terms that related to modern society, this is where I understood that Christianity was going to go through an evolutionary change. Barth's ideology played a resounding part in this chapter. He believed, for one, that people need to stop trying to understand God so much or "reach up to God like the tower of Babel," but people must rather "accept the fact that we can know of God only what God reveals." I noted through the text that a principle of modern Christian theology could in fact be a search for the truth. Although Barth discredits this process, I think it is one of the most important aspects of modern Christianity. Natural religion has definitely contributed to the search for the truth about God. Bultmann is another person whose influence on modern Christianity is rather influential int he chapter. His take on inauthentic and authentic existence is very much relatable to today's world. He believed that the process of one getting tied up with "average" day to day affairs is a sin, because you are denying living for Christ, or leading an authentic life. You will rather busy, or so as Bultmann would say, distract yourself with the small features of your day than live for a bigger purpose. If this is the case, than the whole world is guilty of this sin. However, Bultmann knows that it is nearly impossible to not lead an inauthentic lifestyle and suggests instead that we rely on God's everlasting love and forgiveness to cope with the fact that we cannot lead authentic lives. There is plenty of references to new ways of living as well. The left winged followers of the chapter went against Bultmann in believing that Christianity should be concerned with the possibility of a new way of living. The right winged Bultmannians agree that Jesus lies "inextricably at the foundations of the Christian faith." Some argued that Jesus's life is metaphoric and is not achievable, while others argued that Jesus's life is merely the starting point of Christianity and should be seen as the foundation of Christian life. From my church experience, I have never seen the Bible or Jesus' life interpreted metaphorically. I have always heard or been told that one should ascribe to be "Christ-like" and live as much like Christ as possible. This always bothered me because that is impossible, not nearly impossible, or almost impossible, but FLAT OUT impossible. Why ascribe to be something that you know you cannot reach when it is also taught that God loves you for who YOU are? Not for who you are in Jesus. . . Regardless of the fact, the end of the chapter posed an emphasis on the Catholic take on social reform. You can see a shift from Catholics only worrying of their own salvation and lives and to that of others. The chapter says this was attributed to the study of Thomas Aquinas. I believe the time period was perfect for the switch to wanting social reform because at the time child labor laws became prominent, sweatshops were shut down, racism and discrimination was being fought, and so on and so forth. It seems almost bandwagon-ish for the Catholic Church to suddenly turn it's attention to social reform. I see this as a way for the church to gain new followers and just transition into what seems popular at the time. 
- Chapter 18: The End of Western Christendom	Rudolf Bultmann was a theologian that adopted his ideas from surrounding milieu; these ideas turned optimism to talk of boundary situations and crises and our responsibility as we face death alone. Theologians in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, and women and blacks in the U.S. also, moved theology away from the assumptions of traditional European culture. When this century was beginning, Ernest Troeltsch argued that Christianity would endure as long as Western culture, which wasn’t as encouraging a thought any longer, therefore Christian theology was looking for new ways to define its own identity.  As Karl Barth was emerging and studied the Bible more, he found a “strange new world” there, “something very ancient, early oriental, indefinably sunny, wild, and original.” Barth rejected all of the 19th century efforts to show the cultural superiority of Christianity and honed theology down to the claim that through this very ambiguous, imperfect Christian faith God chooses to be revealed. Karl Barth thought that replacing 19th century liberalism with existentialism didn’t deal with or fix the actual problem, it only attempted to find human words adequate to God’s Word, which there are none adequate. Nazi ideology owed more to neopaganism that to Christianity, and the most committed Nazis always intended to follow the murder of the Jews with the destruction of Christianity. Human beings cannot reach God, but God has come to human beings, and Barth increasingly found that this fact led him to find positive things about humanity. Barth’s determination to not letting modern culture shape Christian faith led many liberal readers to feel that he simply repeated biblical language, but he kept the conservatives off guard also with his attacks on “religion” and profound reinterpretations of the traditional doctrines. Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a part of a church that was in opposition to Hitler, but Bonhoeffer remained in Germany. Because of this, the Nazis arrested him but while in his jail cell Bonhoeffer continued to write theology in the form of letters. Bonhoeffer thought that “religion” has come to mean an individualism that turns away from the world to worry about one’s own salvation. He also believed that God wasn’t supposed to be at the boundary of our lives, He should be the center of our lives. Bonhoeffer was also looking for ways to preach Christ to people in a world where all of the old assumptions at the foundation of religion no longer seemed to make sense. Charles Hodge and Benjamin B. Warfield had defined orthodoxy as based on the infallibility of the Bible. Though Hodge rejected much of modern sciences conclusions, he accepts its way of thinking.  He acknowledged that the inspiration of the biblical writers extended only to teaching what God wanted them to teach us. Rauschenbusch said that Christians had come to pay too much attention to individual salvation and not enough to the call for social change Implied in the symbol of the kingdom of God. A young pastor by the name of Reinhold Niebuhr shared Rauschenbusch’s concern for social reform became active in liberal and socialist movements, but, both politically and theologically, the social gospel movement’s dream of steadily improving society until we achieve the kingdom of God seemed too simple to him. 
- Chapter 18	I really liked the part on existentialism since it's something i've read about before and i like the ideas and questions it brings about. The book stated: "As Heidegger always emphasizes, we are all going to die, and that means we have finite time; in choosing to do some things, we pass up chance to do others -- and live with the consequences, knowing that we are responsible for them. Most people avoid facing up to this fact. They sink into 'everydayness,' 'averageness,' and 'idle chatter,' worrying about what to have for dinner, what to do this weekend, and never asking what they want to make of their lives" (257). If i could get all of that printed on a t-shirt, i would. I believe that thinking about your life and what you want to make of it is so important. I also fully believe that there is purpose in everything, big or small. But to find any sort of purpose for our lives, we have to break away from this "everydayness" and "averageness" that pretty much everyone gets stuck in. We have to do something different. For me, personally, i don't want to be average and sit back and do the same things the people before me or the people around me have done. That's safe and boring. It doesn't get you anywhere. I want to take risks, and be bold, and stand out, do something different and be different so that i can make an impact in the lives around me and hopefully, the world. I do this through acknowledging that death is inevitable, so i have to take the time i have on this earth and use it ever so wisely in order to not waste the life i have been given. I have to live and choose to live. And a main part of doing this is taking my faith along with me. Spreading the hope and love that Jesus brought to us is what i want to take around to other people. People who are longing for something more, something different. I want to show others that there is a way to get by in this messed up world, that redemption isn't far. And i can't do that if i sit around and be average, being consumed with the petty things of the world.
- Placher, Chapter 18	Barth wanted Christianity to be as radical as possible to step away from the normality of 19th century Christianity. He believe that faith was beyond human understanding and that we can't prove that Jesus was better than any other religious leader. We can't understand God on our own or through other people's words. We can only understand through God himself. I agree partially because I think everyone needs their own personal revelation with God, but I also think their has to be so,e uniformity. I also think that you have to take what other people preach into consideration. It may not fit your ideology completely, but you can take truths out of many people's statements and find your own truth. Princeton's orthodoxy saw the Bible as literal truths, as in a collection of facts. I personally don't believe everything is literal in the Bible. I think their is concepts we can't personally fathom so they are written metaphorically, like poetry. I also believe in evolution to a certain extinct which Princeton's orthodoxy went against. Rauschenbusch believed we needed to step away from individual salvation and focus on society. We should focus more on taking Earth to a heavenly status. I like the fact that he wanted to put emphasis on society and making Earth better. I feel as if a person should think about their individual salvation but that shouldn't be the reason behind their good works. They should want to make things better regardless of where they go. Bultman believed in existentialism. He believed we don't need facts about Jesus, and we didn't need any proof. He believed if we needed proof to believe in God, then our faith is compromised. We can't have a personal commitment without faith. Humans decide what to make of their lives and don't have a universal nature. I love this ideology. Everyone has the opportunity to create their lives but many times people find excuses. I believe that God already knows everything that we are going to do, but he gives you multiple paths to take in life and he leaves free will for us to pick which path, in which he will help us down. I completely agree with the quote, "if God loves us even in our sin, we can risk living authentically." If God loves me regardless of my sins, I should be able to really live my life the way I want to and learning from my mistakes and sins I make along the way. Catholic theology moved more toward a search for truth instead of eternal truths. It focused on evolutionary growth of nature working towards grace, and the world moving toward the kingdom of God. 
- Chapter 18 	The Idea of Individual men is very interesting. like saying that we do act different because of society and because being a part of a group makes us act in ways to protect that group even thought if we are alone we would not do the same thing. and I think that is very interesting because we can understand a lot about how we ready the bible if we have this type of idea in mind. 
- The End of Western Christendom	During the early 20th century Barth thought that something was wrong with theological tradition. He believed that the grace of God in Christ was possible. Barth said that parts of the Bible reflected the author's bias and assumptions. He said Paul "knew something about God and managed to communicate it through biased, inadequate human words." Barth believed that pastors should "speak of God. We are human beings that, however, and so cannot speak of God." He impacted theology with his commentary on Romans. He attacked all "natural theology." He believed our effort to understand God and religion as the ultimate sin. He sees it as the Towel of Babel situation. This help to shed light on what I perceived this story as. Everybody in this world wanted to reach the ultimate goal of getting to heaven by building something physical to get there. Barth sees the urgency of people trying to get to God as a sin. I agree with him about only knowing what God reveals to us. He said that the knowledge of God begins with Jesus Christ. Barth had thoughts like Calvin who believed that there was imposing limits on God's grace. He disagreed with infant baptism. Bonhoeffer was in church opposition with Hitler. Bonhoeffer saw that "religion" came to the point of "individualism." Hodge and Warfield came up with an orthodoxy based on the Bible not having the ability to be wrong. Believed the Bible had literal truth in every statement. Hodge rejected the conclusion of modern science. Hodge came up with "mechanical theory of inspiration" in which biblical writers express themselves by their culture and do not take word for word dictation from God. The five fundamental points are bible inerrancy, the virgin birth, the satisfaction theory of the atonement, bodily resurrection, and the miracles of Jesus. Rauschenbusch said that Christians pay so much attention to self salvation and none toward changing their environment. Niebuhr agreed with Rauschenbusch and that no party or cause can be unambiguously good. Bultmann was a New Testament scholar and pioneered "form criticism."Studied the development of ideas in early church, NOT to learn about the history of Jesus' life. Existentialism is the movement of embracing Jews, Christians, and atheists. He believes you cannot understand humans like scientists do, because humans do not have a nature. 
- William C. Placher, Chapter 18	American Theologists criticized American culture.  Karl Barth was a Swiss pastor that wanted to separate the grace of God and Christian superiority.  Rudolf Bultmann used existentialism in his philosophy.  The Catholic church began to ask whether or not its philosophy held all of the absolute truths, especially concerning salvation.  Theology moved even further away from the traditional European and Catholic thought as a result of theology from Africa, Latin America, Asia, and women in blacks in the US.  Karl Barth studied the Bible and found it to be very radical and original; it made other theology seem dull.  Theologists tried to pick and choose parts of the Bible that went along with their culture or ideas.  Because we are human, the search for sufficient theology is inherently impossible.  However, Barth did not agree that existentialism solved many theological problems, it only tried to find the words to explain God but there aren't adequate words.  Barth did not agree with natural theology at all.  Barth was very bold against conforming the church to the Nazi party.  Barth argued that because Jesus was human, God authenticated the value in humanity. Barth criticized Calvin only for separating the elect because it limits God's grace.  However, Barth never confirmed a belief in universal salvation. Hodge rejected many conclusions of science but called the Bible a storehouse of facts.  Fundamentalism became increasingly popular, especially amongst Americans.  The social gospel movement was trailblazed by Rauschenbusch, who believed that Christians were not paying enough attention to society as a whole.  Nothing organized by humans is perfect and any institution is full of imperfections and impurities.  Bultmann was considered a New Testament scholar and was more concerned with how the early church developed and not as concerned with the histology of Jesus' life.  Existientialism  is the idea that humans do not have a true nature and we cannot understand humans in a scientific way. Bultmann related existentialism to Jesus  through the message of forgiveness and how people are freed through forgiveness.  The Catholic theologies became popular with Pope Leo XIII when debates about abortion, birth control, celibacy, etc began.  Lonergan argued that awareness does not come from correctness or the truth, because the truth will never be settled upon, but that it comes from following a particular method centered around good thinking and good questions.  Rainier brought up the idea of mystery and that mystery is extremely pervasive.  Some people began to believe that grace could work outside of the church realm.
- Chap 18: The end of Western Christendom	"In the 20th century, the biggest issue facing Christianity was the incorporation of contemporary culturei into Christian theology. In addition, Christianity started to entail a broader outlook where Western civilization was not the core focus. No longer was theology stuck in Europe or America. This allowed for the plurality of expressions of Christian theology that was once only Westernized. Germany, for example, developed German war theology to express the superiority of Christianity. Oppositions to the German War theology paid huge prices, some even with their lives and livelihood, during the rise of Nazism and the World Wars. Barth was a believer in the opposition. Christianity, to Barth, was far from perfect. The imperfection of Christianity is that  we only know God through what he reveals and our limited understanding. This seemed to me to hark on earlier notions of Realism and Nietzsche. Some believed that the Christian toleration of anti-Semitism propelled Nazism. I find that interesting because theology has progressed to the idea of theological liberalism in the 19th century, which emphasized ethics, yet it still rationalized anti-Semitism as contemporary culture. Still today the question remains, how does Christianity incorporate contemporary culture to allow progressivity without loosing core values and ethics? Barth answered how to rationalize the evil of his day, explaining it as impossible to rationalize evil since it exists and we should understand it as potent for knowing that God is unable to save everyone. The 20th century also was the era of Fundamentalism in America. Fundamentalism stood on principles of biblical inerrancy, virgin birth, Christ atoned for our sins, bodily resurrection, and miracles. Fundamentalism stood as a reaction to contemporary culture being more secular. This notion may seem antiquated today but it still important to the Church and society as a whole, since we still have debates whether prayer in schools is necessary.  The social gospel movement also came in this era,birthed from liberalism theology,  it focused on issues of the poor and working class to enact social reform and political changes to help the often undermined Christian believer. As exegetical criticism became popular in America, some theologians sought to revive earlier processes, such as Bultmann and Heideggarian existentialism. America showed a plurality in Christian theology during the 20th century. 
- One can also point to the improvement in Catholic theology moving away from the dichotomies in Christianity and focusing on growth within Christianity as a contemporary outlook Vatican II made the Church more inclusive of the community and  described  instances like the Cold War's arms race to mean a turn to economic concern instead of humanity. Overall, the 20th sought to improve society and Christianity. "
- Chap. 18	In just reading the beginning of the chapter, where it mentions that theology had tried to identify Christianity, it made me try to figure out what non-Christians see Christians as. And depending on where you are from and with whom you have grown up with, I think that as a whole, Christians are seen as 1. goody-goody 2. hypocritical 3. in-your-face 4. "always looking for an argument" and 5. always right (I'm sure theres more). And I think it is this way because there has been a huge change in the U.S. in politics/gender change/feminism......and for us Christians we try to follow what the Bible says and because we are staying the same and not evolving with the world we become the "bad guy" because we believe in certain things that the world cannot accept because they do not want to stop doing wrong because they are so use to it so instead of them changing the world has to change to accept them. And today we "have" to accept them because feelings will get hurt.
*** Surprise
- The idea of Bultmann denying crucial things to the Christian faith such as Jesus being raised from the dead on the third day after his crusifixtion.
- Niebuhr insisted that humans ascribing for social reform will not make humans good. I found this rather bleak. This surprised me because there is no mention of redemption through man's want for social reform. This seemed like a Marxist statement. It also surprised me that the chapter seemed to blame Christians for the anti-Semitic movement. There were many other factors that contributed to this and not just Christianity. Maybe I am a little ignorant to the topic but I not believe Christian views on the Jews was the only contributing factor to the hate of the whole race. 
- Liberal commentators tried to sort out the parts of the Bible that reflected the author’s own biases or the assumption of his culture, with the hope of eliminating the residue of that earlier culture and restarting Christianity in terms of appropriate to our modern society. "Faith is . . . beyond all human ideas and affirmations . . ., beyond every positive religious achievement . . . It is always a leap into the darkness of the unknown, a flight into empty air." -Karl Barth. Every effort to show the ethical superiority of Christianity to other religions of theologies collapses in failure. Barth said that religion is the ultimate sin, the effort to reach up to God like the tower of Babel; we must accept that we can only know about God what God reveals. If the Christians before the 1930s had firmly denounced the anti-Semitism, then the Holocaust could have not happened. According to Barth, all Christians can say about evil is that Christ defeated it.
- When it was talking about the Nazis and anti-Semitism, this quote really stuck out: "If Christians in the generation before the 1930s had firmly denounced anti-Semitism, the Holocaust could not have happened. That fact must haunt Christian theology for the rest of history" (251). First, I found this claim to be fairly bold. I also didn't know that Christians had tolerated anti-Semitism and let sermons denouncing Jews (for example, calling them "Christ-killers") to happen. Thus, thinking more about this statement, it rings some truth. If there had not been such a hatred of Jews at this time, then would Hitler have been motivated to consider killing them? Would the idea even cross his mind? or would it still have happened anyway? I don't know. However, it's pretty disappointing that "Christians" allowed hate against a single group of people to occur and be preached about it, fueling an evil that changed the course of history forever.
- I knew that Nazis killed Jews, but I did not know they intended to murder Jews with the destruction of Christianity. I like how Heidegger describes the "inauthentic existence."
- I am not really surprised to read about what I read about the German Nazi's but I did learn things I did not previously know and that I was surprised I never learned before.  I did not know the Nazi's tried to use the church as propaganda and that after they killed the Jews planned to destroy Christianity.  I found the idea that if the previous generation to the 1930's had been more strongly against anti-Semitism that the Holocaust couldn't have happened very interesting.  
- Ethical liberalism in the 19th century has progressed into a less humane theology like German War theology of the 20th century. 
- Also that the Catholic church had a contemporary shift, the same institution, that had been antiquated for quite some time. 
- It surprises me that Christianity is split up so, that now there are so many groups of "Christians" that cannot agree with each other which in turn give them their own identity, not so much in Christianity what in "Christianity" where what they believe is right. Christianity is so diverse.
*** Questions
- Bonhoeffer tried to define the possibility of a religionless Christianity. I really really really would like to know what Christianity would be if it was religionless then? Is Christianity not a religion and if not, than what is it?
- On page 250 the book talks about Paul knowing something about God and that he managed to communicate it through biased inadequate human words. Does this mean that because God is in fact God, that Paul’s words are not able to fully describe God’s attributes and His power and Abilities? With the thought that Christians before the 1930s could have prevented the holocaust if they denounced the anti-Semitism ideologies, do you agree with this? I feel that Hitler would have still gone after the Jewish population because he wanted only the Aryan race to survive because they were mostly purebred German. How would you explain the connection between the three big theological thinkers in this time period?
- No questions
- Is extistentalism considered a form of Christianity?
- I really want to know what Rahner thought that the Catholic church was keeping in secret. like why would you say that most of their theology was secrets?
- Barth believed, "As ministers we ought to speak of God. We are human beings that, however, and so cannot speak of God" (pg. 250). This quote was just ultimately confusing. I do not know if he is contradicting himself or if there is an underline criteria that is spoken of, but is not clarified in the reading. 
- Barth said that religion is the ultimate sin because we try to reach up to God like the tower of Babel.  However, if someone wants to have a relationship with God, doesn't that require intimacy? Intimacy requires closeness and a passion for getting closer and closer to God.  As one falls more in love with God, one would want to know him more.  So why would it be a sin to try to reach God out of a passion for God?  When Barth talks about universal salvation, is he referring literally to everyone born? How would "anticommunism" be more dangerous to Christianity than communism?
- Should I understand that the movement towards exegitical criticism in the 20th century caused most theologians to hold traditional thoughts or were they progressive still? 
- If people who call themselves Christians, but don't follow the Bible, why do they continue to call themselves Christians? Is there a sense of authority to them? Why can't they have a different name instead of making Christians look bad? Whats is so powerful about the word Christian, to those who are "fake" who don't truly believe, that they want to change the meaning of it?

*** Essays

  1.  In Placher's description of process theology and particularly as developed by Alfred North Whitehead, we are asked to shift our understanding of the world from "discreet chunks of stuff" to a world made up of "processes." Think of a significant religious or spiritual experience you have witnessed and describe it as "interrelated processes" rather than "things." In other words describe it by the verbs at work rather than the nouns.
  2. On p. 265, Placher makes reference to the conflict between "monastery" and "university" -- illustrated 1,000 years ago with Bernard and Abelard. In more recent decades he says there has developed a distinction between theology done for the sake of the church and theology done for the sake of the secular world. Choose two of the thinkers dealt with in the text to illustrate the distinction. Describe each in 1-2 paragraphs.
  3. On p. 266 he describes 2 contrasting images of theology, one as a kind of wheel and the other as a matrix with many nodes. In 2-3 paragraphs explain the images.
  4.  On p. 267 Placher says that 3rd world theologians have developed a theology that does what the best theology has always done: "make Christianity address the particular problems of their societies." Explain what he means with at least 2 illustrations from our own society.
  5.  How did James Cone use the term "black" to become a "potentially universal symbol"?
  6. On p. 270 Placher links the work of feminist liberation with "healing of the environment". Explain.
  7. Frequently "pluralism" is said to be an important characteristic of the postmodern world. How does it impact the relationship of Christianity to other religions?
  8. How did Barth's commentary on Romans have an "explosive impact on theology."
  9. What did Bonhoeffer's mean by his concept of "Cheap Grace"?
  10. In 2-3 paragraphs provide a brief description and explanation of the importance of Reinhold Niehbuhr for American theology.
